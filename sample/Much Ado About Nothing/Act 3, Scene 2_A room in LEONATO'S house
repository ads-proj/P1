I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, andthen go I toward Arragon.I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'llvouchsafe me.Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new glossof your marriage as to show a child his new coatand forbid him to wear it. I will only be boldwith Benedick for his company; for, from the crownof his head to the sole of his foot, he is allmirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid'sbow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot athim; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and histongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks histongue speaks.Gallants, I am not as I have been.So say I	methinks you are sadder.I hope he be in love.Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood inhim, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,he wants money.I have the toothache.Draw it.Hang it!You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.What! sigh for the toothache?Where is but a humour or a worm.Well, every one can master a grief but he that hasit.Yet say I, he is in love.There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it bea fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to bea Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in theshape of two countries at once, as, a German fromthe waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard fromthe hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancyto this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is nofool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.If he be not in love with some woman, there is nobelieving old signs: a' brushes his hat o'mornings; what should that bode?Hath any man seen him at the barber's?No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,and the old ornament of his cheek hath alreadystuffed tennis-balls.Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell himout by that?That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.The greatest note of it is his melancholy.And when was he wont to wash his face?Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hearwhat they say of him.Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept intoa lute-string and now governed by stops.Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,conclude he is in love.Nay, but I know who loves him.That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite ofall, dies for him.She shall be buried with her face upwards.Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Oldsignior, walk aside with me: I have studied eightor nine wise words to speak to you, which thesehobby-horses must not hear.For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by thisplayed their parts with Beatrice; and then the twobears will not bite one another when they meet.My lord and brother, God save you!Good den, brother.If your leisure served, I would speak with you.In private?If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; forwhat I would speak of concerns him.What's the matter?[To CLAUDIO]  Means your lordship to be marriedto-morrow?You know he does.I know not that, when he knows what I know.If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.You may think I love you not: let that appearhereafter, and aim better at me by that I now willmanifest. For my brother, I think he holds youwell, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effectyour ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent andlabour ill bestowed.Why, what's the matter?I came hither to tell you; and, circumstancesshortened, for she has been too long a talking of,the lady is disloyal.Who, Hero?Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:Disloyal?The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; Icould say she were worse: think you of a worsetitle, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not tillfurther warrant: go but with me to-night, you shallsee her chamber-window entered, even the nightbefore her wedding-day: if you love her then,to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honourto change your mind.May this be so?I will not think it.If you dare not trust that you see, confess notthat you know: if you will follow me, I will showyou enough; and when you have seen more and heardmore, proceed accordingly.If I see any thing to-night why I should not marryher to-morrow in the congregation, where I shouldwed, there will I shame her.And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will joinwith thee to disgrace her.I will disparage her no farther till you are mywitnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, andlet the issue show itself.O day untowardly turned!O mischief strangely thwarting!O plague right well prevented! so will you say whenyou have seen the sequel.
