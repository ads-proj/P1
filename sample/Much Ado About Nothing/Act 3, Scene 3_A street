Are you good men and true?Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffersalvation, body and soul.Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, ifthey should have any allegiance in them, beingchosen for the prince's watch.Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.First, who think you the most desertless man to beconstable?Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they canwrite and read.Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessedyou with a good name: to be a well-favoured man isthe gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.Both which, master constable,--You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and makeno boast of it; and for your writing and reading,let that appear when there is no need of suchvanity. You are thought here to be the mostsenseless and fit man for the constable of thewatch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is yourcharge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you areto bid any man stand, in the prince's name.How if a' will not stand?Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; andpresently call the rest of the watch together andthank God you are rid of a knave.If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is noneof the prince's subjects.True, and they are to meddle with none but theprince's subjects. You shall also make no noise inthe streets; for, for the watch to babble and totalk is most tolerable and not to be endured.We will rather sleep than talk: we know whatbelongs to a watch.Why, you speak like an ancient and most quietwatchman; for I cannot see how sleeping shouldoffend: only, have a care that your bills be notstolen. Well, you are to call at all theale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.How if they will not?Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: ifthey make you not then the better answer, you maysay they are not the men you took them for.Well, sir.If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtueof your office, to be no true man; and, for suchkind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,why the more is for your honesty.If we know him to be a thief, shall we not layhands on him?Truly, by your office, you may; but I think theythat touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceableway for you, if you do take a thief, is to let himshow himself what he is and steal out of your company.You have been always called a merciful man, partner.Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much morea man who hath any honesty in him.If you hear a child cry in the night, you must callto the nurse and bid her still it.How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wakeher with crying; for the ewe that will not hear herlamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.'Tis very true.This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, areto present the prince's own person: if you meet theprince in the night, you may stay him.Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knowsthe statutes, he may stay him: marry, not withoutthe prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch oughtto offend no man; and it is an offence to stay aman against his will.By'r lady, I think it be so.Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there beany matter of weight chances, call up me: keep yourfellows' counsels and your own; and good night.Come, neighbour.Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit hereupon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watchabout Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding beingthere to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.What Conrade![Aside]  Peace! stir not.Conrade, I say!Here, man; I am at thy elbow.Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would ascab follow.I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forwardwith thy tale.Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, forit drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,utter all to thee.[Aside]  Some treason, masters: yet stand close.Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible anyvillany should be so rich; for when rich villainshave need of poor ones, poor ones may make whatprice they will.I wonder at it.That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest thatthe fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, isnothing to a man.Yes, it is apparel.I mean, the fashion.Yes, the fashion is the fashion.Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. Butseest thou not what a deformed thief this fashionis?[Aside]  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vilethief this seven year; a' goes up and down like agentleman: I remember his name.Didst thou not hear somebody?No; 'twas the vane on the house.Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief thisfashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hotbloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiersin the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel'spriests in the old church-window, sometime like theshaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?All this I see; and I see that the fashion wearsout more apparel than the man. But art not thouthyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hastshifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?Not so, neither: but know that I have to-nightwooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by thename of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'chamber-window, bids me a thousand times goodnight,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should firsttell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,planted and placed and possessed by my master DonJohn, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.And thought they Margaret was Hero?Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but thedevil my master knew she was Margaret; and partlyby his oaths, which first possessed them, partly bythe dark night, which did deceive them, but chieflyby my villany, which did confirm any slander thatDon John had made, away went Claudio enraged; sworehe would meet her, as he was appointed, next morningat the temple, and there, before the wholecongregation, shame her with what he saw o'er nightand send her home again without a husband.We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!Call up the right master constable. We have hererecovered the most dangerous piece of lechery thatever was known in the commonwealth.And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'wears a lock.Masters, masters,--You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.Masters,--Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being takenup of these men's bills.A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.
