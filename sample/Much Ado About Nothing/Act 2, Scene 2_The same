It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry thedaughter of Leonato.Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.Any bar, any cross, any impediment will bemedicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,and whatsoever comes athwart his affection rangesevenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that nodishonesty shall appear in me.Show me briefly how.I think I told your lordship a year since, how muchI am in the favour of Margaret, the waitinggentlewoman to Hero.I remember.I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you tothe prince your brother; spare not to tell him thathe hath wronged his honour in marrying the renownedClaudio--whose estimation do you mightily holdup--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.What proof shall I make of that?Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for anyother issue?Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro andthe Count Claudio alone: tell them that you knowthat Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to theprince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother'shonour, who hath made this match, and his friend'sreputation, who is thus like to be cozened with thesemblance of a maid,--that you have discoveredthus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:offer them instances; which shall bear no lesslikelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term meClaudio; and bring them to see this the very nightbefore the intended wedding,--for in the meantime Iwill so fashion the matter that Hero shall beabsent,--and there shall appear such seeming truthof Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be calledassurance and all the preparation overthrown.Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will putit in practise. Be cunning in the working this, andthy fee is a thousand ducats.Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunningshall not shame me.I will presently go learn their day of marriage.
