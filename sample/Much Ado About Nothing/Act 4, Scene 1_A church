Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plainform of marriage, and you shall recount theirparticular duties afterwards.You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.No.To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.I do.If either of you know any inward impediment why youshould not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,to utter it.Know you any, Hero?None, my lord.Know you any, count?I dare make his answer, none.O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men dailydo, not knowing what they do!How now! interjections? Why, then, some be oflaughing, as, ah, ha, he!Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:Will you with free and unconstrained soulGive me this maid, your daughter?As freely, son, as God did give her me.And what have I to give you back, whose worthMay counterpoise this rich and precious gift?Nothing, unless you render her again.Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.There, Leonato, take her back again:Give not this rotten orange to your friend;She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.Behold how like a maid she blushes here!O, what authority and show of truthCan cunning sin cover itself withal!Comes not that blood as modest evidenceTo witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,All you that see her, that she were a maid,By these exterior shows? But she is none:She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.What do you mean, my lord?Not to be married,Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,And made defeat of her virginity,--I know what you would say: if I have known her,You will say she did embrace me as a husband,And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:No, Leonato,I never tempted her with word too large;But, as a brother to his sister, show'dBashful sincerity and comely love.And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:You seem to me as Dian in her orb,As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;But you are more intemperate in your bloodThan Venus, or those pamper'd animalsThat rage in savage sensuality.Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?Sweet prince, why speak not you?What should I speak?I stand dishonour'd, that have gone aboutTo link my dear friend to a common stale.Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.This looks not like a nuptial.True! O God!Leonato, stand I here?Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?All this is so: but what of this, my lord?Let me but move one question to your daughter;And, by that fatherly and kindly powerThat you have in her, bid her answer truly.I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.O, God defend me! how am I beset!What kind of catechising call you this?To make you answer truly to your name.Is it not Hero? Who can blot that nameWith any just reproach?Marry, that can Hero;Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.What man was he talk'd with you yesternightOut at your window betwixt twelve and one?Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,Myself, my brother and this grieved countDid see her, hear her, at that hour last nightTalk with a ruffian at her chamber-windowWho hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,Confess'd the vile encounters they have hadA thousand times in secret.Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,Not to be spoke of;There is not chastity enough in languageWithout offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,If half thy outward graces had been placedAbout thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,Thou pure impiety and impious purity!For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,And never shall it more be gracious.Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,Smother her spirits up.How doth the lady?Dead, I think. Help, uncle!Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.Death is the fairest cover for her shameThat may be wish'd for.How now, cousin Hero!Have comfort, lady.Dost thou look up?Yea, wherefore should she not?Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thingCry shame upon her? Could she here denyThe story that is printed in her blood?Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?Why had I not with charitable handTook up a beggar's issue at my gates,Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,I might have said 'No part of it is mine;This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?But mine and mine I loved and mine I praisedAnd mine that I was proud on, mine so muchThat I myself was to myself not mine,Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallenInto a pit of ink, that the wide seaHath drops too few to wash her clean againAnd salt too little which may season giveTo her foul-tainted flesh!Sir, sir, be patient.For my part, I am so attired in wonder,I know not what to say.O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?No, truly not; although, until last night,I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger madeWhich was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.Hear me a little;For I have only been silent so longAnd given way unto this course of fortune....By noting of the lady I have mark'dA thousand blushing apparitionsTo start into her face, a thousand innocent shamesIn angel whiteness beat away those blushes;And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,To burn the errors that these princes holdAgainst her maiden truth. Call me a fool;Trust not my reading nor my observations,Which with experimental seal doth warrantThe tenor of my book; trust not my age,My reverence, calling, nor divinity,If this sweet lady lie not guiltless hereUnder some biting error.Friar, it cannot be.Thou seest that all the grace that she hath leftIs that she will not add to her damnationA sin of perjury; she not denies it:Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuseThat which appears in proper nakedness?Lady, what man is he you are accused of?They know that do accuse me; I know none:If I know more of any man aliveThan that which maiden modesty doth warrant,Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,Prove you that any man with me conversedAt hours unmeet, or that I yesternightMaintain'd the change of words with any creature,Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!There is some strange misprision in the princes.Two of them have the very bent of honour;And if their wisdoms be misled in this,The practise of it lives in John the bastard,Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.I know not. If they speak but truth of her,These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,The proudest of them shall well hear of it.Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,Nor age so eat up my invention,Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,Both strength of limb and policy of mind,Ability in means and choice of friends,To quit me of them throughly.Pause awhile,And let my counsel sway you in this case.Your daughter here the princes left for dead:Let her awhile be secretly kept in,And publish it that she is dead indeed;Maintain a mourning ostentationAnd on your family's old monumentHang mournful epitaphs and do all ritesThat appertain unto a burial.What shall become of this? what will this do?Marry, this well carried shall on her behalfChange slander to remorse; that is some good:But not for that dream I on this strange course,But on this travail look for greater birth.She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,Upon the instant that she was accused,Shall be lamented, pitied and excusedOf every hearer: for it so falls outThat what we have we prize not to the worthWhiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,Why, then we rack the value, then we findThe virtue that possession would not show usWhiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:When he shall hear she died upon his words,The idea of her life shall sweetly creepInto his study of imagination,And every lovely organ of her lifeShall come apparell'd in more precious habit,More moving-delicate and full of life,Into the eye and prospect of his soul,Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,If ever love had interest in his liver,And wish he had not so accused her,No, though he thought his accusation true.Let this be so, and doubt not but successWill fashion the event in better shapeThan I can lay it down in likelihood.But if all aim but this be levell'd false,The supposition of the lady's deathWill quench the wonder of her infamy:And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,As best befits her wounded reputation,In some reclusive and religious life,Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:And though you know my inwardness and loveIs very much unto the prince and Claudio,Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in thisAs secretly and justly as your soulShould with your body.Being that I flow in grief,The smallest twine may lead me.'Tis well consented: presently away;For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-dayPerhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?Yea, and I will weep a while longer.I will not desire that.You have no reason; I do it freely.Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!Is there any way to show such friendship?A very even way, but no such friend.May a man do it?It is a man's office, but not yours.I do love nothing in the world so well as you: isnot that strange?As strange as the thing I know not. It were aspossible for me to say I loved nothing so well asyou: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; Iconfess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.Do not swear, and eat it.I will swear by it that you love me; and I will makehim eat it that says I love not you.Will you not eat your word?With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protestI love thee.Why, then, God forgive me!What offence, sweet Beatrice?You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about toprotest I loved you.And do it with all thy heart.I love you with so much of my heart that none isleft to protest.Come, bid me do any thing for thee.Kill Claudio.Ha! not for the wide world.You kill me to deny it. Farewell.Tarry, sweet Beatrice.I am gone, though I am here: there is no love inyou: nay, I pray you, let me go.Beatrice,--In faith, I will go.We'll be friends first.You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.Is Claudio thine enemy?Is he not approved in the height a villain, thathath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? Othat I were a man! What, bear her in hand until theycome to take hands; and then, with publicaccusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heartin the market-place.Hear me, Beatrice,--Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!Nay, but, Beatrice,--Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.Beat--Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that Ihad any friend would be a man for my sake! Butmanhood is melted into courtesies, valour intocompliment, and men are only turned into tongue, andtrim ones too: he is now as valiant as Herculesthat only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be aman with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I willkiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,Claudio shall render me a dear account. As youhear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort yourcousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.
