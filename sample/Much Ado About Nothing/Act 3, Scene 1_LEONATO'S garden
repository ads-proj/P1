Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;There shalt thou find my cousin BeatriceProposing with the prince and Claudio:Whisper her ear and tell her, I and UrsulaWalk in the orchard and our whole discourseIs all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;And bid her steal into the pleached bower,Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,Made proud by princes, that advance their prideAgainst that power that bred it: there will she hide her,To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,As we do trace this alley up and down,Our talk must only be of Benedick.When I do name him, let it be thy partTo praise him more than ever man did merit:My talk to thee must be how BenedickIs sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matterIs little Cupid's crafty arrow made,That only wounds by hearsay.Now begin;For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runsClose by the ground, to hear our conference.The pleasant'st angling is to see the fishCut with her golden oars the silver stream,And greedily devour the treacherous bait:So angle we for Beatrice; who even nowIs couched in the woodbine coverture.Fear you not my part of the dialogue.Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothingOf the false sweet bait that we lay for it.No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;I know her spirits are as coy and wildAs haggerds of the rock.But are you sureThat Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,To wish him wrestle with affection,And never to let Beatrice know of it.Why did you so? Doth not the gentlemanDeserve as full as fortunate a bedAs ever Beatrice shall couch upon?O god of love! I know he doth deserveAs much as may be yielded to a man:But Nature never framed a woman's heartOf prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,Misprising what they look on, and her witValues itself so highly that to herAll matter else seems weak: she cannot love,Nor take no shape nor project of affection,She is so self-endeared.Sure, I think so;And therefore certainly it were not goodShe knew his love, lest she make sport at it.Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;If low, an agate very vilely cut;If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;If silent, why, a block moved with none.So turns she every man the wrong side outAnd never gives to truth and virtue thatWhich simpleness and merit purchaseth.Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.No, not to be so odd and from all fashionsAs Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh meOut of myself, press me to death with wit.Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:It were a better death than die with mocks,Which is as bad as die with tickling.Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.No; rather I will go to BenedickAnd counsel him to fight against his passion.And, truly, I'll devise some honest slandersTo stain my cousin with: one doth not knowHow much an ill word may empoison liking.O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.She cannot be so much without true judgment--Having so swift and excellent a witAs she is prized to have--as to refuseSo rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.He is the only man of Italy.Always excepted my dear Claudio.I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,Goes foremost in report through Italy.Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.When are you married, madam?Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counselWhich is the best to furnish me to-morrow.She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.[Coming forward]What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!No glory lives behind the back of such.And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite theeTo bind our loves up in a holy band;For others say thou dost deserve, and IBelieve it better than reportingly.
