COUNTESSPorter, remember what I gave in charge;And when you have done so, bring the keys to me.Madam, I will.COUNTESSThe plot is laid: if all things fall out right,I shall as famous be by this exploitAs Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,And his achievements of no less account:Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,To give their censure of these rare reports.Madam,According as your ladyship desired,By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.COUNTESSAnd he is welcome. What! is this the man?Madam, it is.COUNTESSIs this the scourge of France?Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroadThat with his name the mothers still their babes?I see report is fabulous and false:I thought I should have seen some Hercules,A second Hector, for his grim aspect,And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimpShould strike such terror to his enemies.Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;But since your ladyship is not at leisure,I'll sort some other time to visit you.COUNTESSWhat means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady cravesTo know the cause of your abrupt departure.Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,I go to certify her Talbot's here.COUNTESSIf thou be he, then art thou prisoner.Prisoner! to whom?COUNTESSTo me, blood-thirsty lord;And for that cause I trained thee to my house.Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,For in my gallery thy picture hangs:But now the substance shall endure the like,And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,That hast by tyranny these many yearsWasted our country, slain our citizensAnd sent our sons and husbands captivate.Ha, ha, ha!COUNTESSLaughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.I laugh to see your ladyship so fondTo think that you have aught but Talbot's shadowWhereon to practise your severity.COUNTESSWhy, art not thou the man?I am indeed.COUNTESSThen have I substance too.No, no, I am but shadow of myself:You are deceived, my substance is not here;For what you see is but the smallest partAnd least proportion of humanity:I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.COUNTESSThis is a riddling merchant for the nonce;He will be here, and yet he is not here:How can these contrarieties agree?That will I show you presently.How say you, madam? are you now persuadedThat Talbot is but shadow of himself?These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,Razeth your cities and subverts your townsAnd in a moment makes them desolate.COUNTESSVictorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:I find thou art no less than fame hath bruitedAnd more than may be gather'd by thy shape.Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;For I am sorry that with reverenceI did not entertain thee as thou art.Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrueThe mind of Talbot, as you did mistakeThe outward composition of his body.What you have done hath not offended me;Nor other satisfaction do I crave,But only, with your patience, that we mayTaste of your wine and see what cates you have;For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.COUNTESSWith all my heart, and think me honouredTo feast so great a warrior in my house.
