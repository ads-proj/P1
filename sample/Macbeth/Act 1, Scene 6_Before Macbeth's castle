This castle hath a pleasant seat; the airNimbly and sweetly recommends itselfUnto our gentle senses.This guest of summer,The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breathSmells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this birdHath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,The air is delicate.See, see, our honour'd hostess!The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach youHow you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,And thank us for your trouble.All our serviceIn every point twice done and then done doubleWere poor and single business to contendAgainst those honours deep and broad wherewithYour majesty loads our house: for those of old,And the late dignities heap'd up to them,We rest your hermits.Where's the thane of Cawdor?We coursed him at the heels, and had a purposeTo be his purveyor: but he rides well;And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp himTo his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,We are your guest to-night.Your servants everHave theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,Still to return your own.Give me your hand;Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,And shall continue our graces towards him.By your leave, hostess.
