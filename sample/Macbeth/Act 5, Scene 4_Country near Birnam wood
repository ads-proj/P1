Cousins, I hope the days are near at handThat chambers will be safe.We doubt it nothing.What wood is this before us?The wood of Birnam.Let every soldier hew him down a boughAnd bear't before him: thereby shall we shadowThe numbers of our host and make discoveryErr in report of us.It shall be done.We learn no other but the confident tyrantKeeps still in Dunsinane, and will endureOur setting down before 't.'Tis his main hope:For where there is advantage to be given,Both more and less have given him the revolt,And none serve with him but constrained thingsWhose hearts are absent too.Let our just censuresAttend the true event, and put we onIndustrious soldiership.The time approachesThat will with due decision make us knowWhat we shall say we have and what we owe.Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:Towards which advance the war.
