I have two nights watched with you, but can perceiveno truth in your report. When was it she last walked?Since his majesty went into the field, I have seenher rise from her bed, throw her night-gown uponher, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and againreturn to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.A great perturbation in nature, to receive at oncethe benefit of sleep, and do the effects ofwatching! In this slumbery agitation, besides herwalking and other actual performances, what, at anytime, have you heard her say?That, sir, which I will not report after her.You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.Neither to you nor any one; having no witness toconfirm my speech.Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.How came she by that light?Why, it stood by her: she has light by hercontinually; 'tis her command.You see, her eyes are open.Ay, but their sense is shut.What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thuswashing her hands: I have known her continue inthis a quarter of an hour.Yet here's a spot.Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes fromher, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, mylord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need wefear who knows it, when none can call our power toaccount?--Yet who would have thought the old manto have had so much blood in him.Do you mark that?The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all withthis starting.Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.She has spoke what she should not, I am sure ofthat: heaven knows what she has known.Here's the smell of the blood still: all theperfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this littlehand. Oh, oh, oh!What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.I would not have such a heart in my bosom for thedignity of the whole body.Well, well, well,--Pray God it be, sir.This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have knownthose which have walked in their sleep who have diedholily in their beds.Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not sopale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; hecannot come out on's grave.Even so?To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What'sdone cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!Will she go now to bed?Directly.Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deedsDo breed unnatural troubles: infected mindsTo their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:More needs she the divine than the physician.God, God forgive us all! Look after her;Remove from her the means of all annoyance,And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.I think, but dare not speak.Good night, good doctor.
