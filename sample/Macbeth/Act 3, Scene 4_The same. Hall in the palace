You know your own degrees; sit down: at firstAnd last the hearty welcome.Thanks to your majesty.Ourself will mingle with society,And play the humble host.Our hostess keeps her state, but in best timeWe will require her welcome.Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;For my heart speaks they are welcome.See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measureThe table round.There's blood on thy face.'Tis Banquo's then.'Tis better thee without than he within.Is he dispatch'd?My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's goodThat did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,Thou art the nonpareil.Most royal sir,Fleance is 'scaped.Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,As broad and general as the casing air:But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound inTo saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,With twenty trenched gashes on his head;The least a death to nature.Thanks for that:There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fledHath nature that in time will venom breed,No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrowWe'll hear, ourselves, again.My royal lord,You do not give the cheer: the feast is soldThat is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;Meeting were bare without it.Sweet remembrancer!Now, good digestion wait on appetite,And health on both!May't please your highness sit.Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,Were the graced person of our Banquo present;Who may I rather challenge for unkindnessThan pity for mischance!His absence, sir,Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highnessTo grace us with your royal company.The table's full.Here is a place reserved, sir.Where?Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?Which of you have done this?What, my good lord?Thou canst not say I did it: never shakeThy gory locks at me.Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;The fit is momentary; upon a thoughtHe will again be well: if much you note him,You shall offend him and extend his passion:Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on thatWhich might appal the devil.O proper stuff!This is the very painting of your fear:This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,Impostors to true fear, would well becomeA woman's story at a winter's fire,Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!Why do you make such faces? When all's done,You look but on a stool.Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!how say you?Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.If charnel-houses and our graves must sendThose that we bury back, our monumentsShall be the maws of kites.What, quite unmann'd in folly?If I stand here, I saw him.Fie, for shame!Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'dToo terrible for the ear: the times have been,That, when the brains were out, the man would die,And there an end; but now they rise again,With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,And push us from our stools: this is more strangeThan such a murder is.My worthy lord,Your noble friends do lack you.I do forget.Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,I have a strange infirmity, which is nothingTo those that know me. Come, love and health to all;Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,And all to all.Our duties, and the pledge.Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;Thou hast no speculation in those eyesWhich thou dost glare with!Think of this, good peers,But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.What man dare, I dare:Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;Take any shape but that, and my firm nervesShall never tremble: or be alive again,And dare me to the desert with thy sword;If trembling I inhabit then, protest meThe baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!Unreal mockery, hence!Why, so: being gone,I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,With most admired disorder.Can such things be,And overcome us like a summer's cloud,Without our special wonder? You make me strangeEven to the disposition that I owe,When now I think you can behold such sights,And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,When mine is blanched with fear.What sights, my lord?I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;Question enrages him. At once, good night:Stand not upon the order of your going,But go at once.Good night; and better healthAttend his majesty!A kind good night to all!It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;Augurs and understood relations haveBy magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forthThe secret'st man of blood. What is the night?Almost at odds with morning, which is which.How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his personAt our great bidding?Did you send to him, sir?I hear it by the way; but I will send:There's not a one of them but in his houseI keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,All causes shall give way: I am in bloodStepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,Returning were as tedious as go o'er:Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.You lack the season of all natures, sleep.Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuseIs the initiate fear that wants hard use:We are yet but young in deed.
