How now! is Jack Cade slain?No, my lord, nor likely to be slain; for they havewon the bridge, killing all those that withstandthem: the lord mayor craves aid of your honour fromthe Tower, to defend the city from the rebels.Such aid as I can spare you shall command;But I am troubled here with them myself;The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower.But get you to Smithfield, and gather head,And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe;Fight for your king, your country and your lives;And so, farewell, for I must hence again.
