Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?Here, sir.They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thoubehavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine ownslaughter-house: therefore thus will I reward thee,the Lent shall be as long again as it is; and thoushalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lackingone.I desire no more.And, to speak truth, thou deservest no less. Thismonument of the victory will I bear;and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heelstill I do come to London, where we will have themayor's sword borne before us.If we mean to thrive and do good, break open thegaols and let out the prisoners.Fear not that, I warrant thee. Come, let's marchtowards London.
