Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,Our simple supper ended, give me leaveIn this close walk to satisfy myself,In craving your opinion of my title,Which is infallible, to England's crown.My lord, I long to hear it at full.Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,The Nevils are thy subjects to command.Then thus:Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whomWas John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;William of Windsor was the seventh and last.Edward the Black Prince died before his fatherAnd left behind him Richard, his only son,Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.Father, the duke hath told the truth:Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.Which now they hold by force and not by right;For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,The issue of the next son should have reign'd.But William of Hatfield died without an heir.The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose lineI claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,Who kept him in captivity till he died.But to the rest.His eldest sister, Anne,My mother, being heir unto the crownMarried Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was sonTo Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.By her I claim the kingdom: she was heirTo Roger Earl of March, who was the sonOf Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:So, if the issue of the elder sonSucceed before the younger, I am king.What plain proceeding is more plain than this?Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,The fourth son; York claims it from the third.Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:It fails not yet, but flourishes in theeAnd in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;And in this private plot be we the firstThat shall salute our rightful sovereignWith honour of his birthright to the crown.Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!We thank you, lords. But I am not your kingTill I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'dWith heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,But with advice and silent secrecy.Do you as I do in these dangerous days:Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,At Buckingham and all the crew of them,Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking thatShall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.My heart assures me that the Earl of WarwickShall one day make the Duke of York a king.And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:Richard shall live to make the Earl of WarwickThe greatest man in England but the king.
