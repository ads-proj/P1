Come, come, they are almost here. How many standfor consulships?Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every oneCoriolanus will carry it.That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, andloves not the common people.Faith, there had been many great men that haveflattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and therebe many that they have loved, they know notwherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, forCoriolanus neither to care whether they love or hatehim manifests the true knowledge he has in theirdisposition; and out of his noble carelessness letsthem plainly see't.If he did not care whether he had their love or no,he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neithergood nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greaterdevotion than can render it him; and leavesnothing undone that may fully discover him theiropposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice anddispleasure of the people is as bad as that which hedislikes, to flatter them for their love.He hath deserved worthily of his country: and hisascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,having been supple and courteous to the people,bonneted, without any further deed to have them atan into their estimation and report: but he hath soplanted his honours in their eyes, and his actionsin their hearts, that for their tongues to besilent, and not confess so much, were a kind ofingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were amalice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluckreproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, theyare coming.Having determined of the Volsces andTo send for Titus Lartius, it remains,As the main point of this our after-meeting,To gratify his noble service thatHath thus stood for his country: therefore,please you,Most reverend and grave elders, to desireThe present consul, and last generalIn our well-found successes, to reportA little of that worthy work perform'dBy Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whomWe met here both to thank and to rememberWith honours like himself.Speak, good Cominius:Leave nothing out for length, and make us thinkRather our state's defective for requitalThan we to stretch it out.Masters o' the people,We do request your kindest ears, and after,Your loving motion toward the common body,To yield what passes here.We are conventedUpon a pleasing treaty, and have heartsInclinable to honour and advanceThe theme of our assembly.Which the ratherWe shall be blest to do, if he rememberA kinder value of the people thanHe hath hereto prized them at.That's off, that's off;I would you rather had been silent. Please youTo hear Cominius speak?Most willingly;But yet my caution was more pertinentThan the rebuke you give it.He loves your peopleBut tie him not to be their bedfellow.Worthy Cominius, speak.Nay, keep your place.Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hearWhat you have nobly done.Your horror's pardon:I had rather have my wounds to heal againThan hear say how I got them.Sir, I hopeMy words disbench'd you not.No, sir: yet oft,When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.You soothed not, therefore hurt not: butyour people,I love them as they weigh.Pray now, sit down.I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sunWhen the alarum were struck than idly sitTo hear my nothings monster'd.Masters of the people,Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--That's thousand to one good one--when you now seeHe had rather venture all his limbs for honourThan one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.I shall lack voice: the deeds of CoriolanusShould not be utter'd feebly. It is heldThat valour is the chiefest virtue, andMost dignifies the haver: if it be,The man I speak of cannot in the worldBe singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he foughtBeyond the mark of others: our then dictator,Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,When with his Amazonian chin he droveThe bristled lips before him: be bestridAn o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's viewSlew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,When he might act the woman in the scene,He proved best man i' the field, and for his meedWas brow-bound with the oak. His pupil ageMan-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,And in the brunt of seventeen battles sinceHe lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,Before and in Corioli, let me say,I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;And by his rare example made the cowardTurn terror into sport: as weeds beforeA vessel under sail, so men obey'dAnd fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,Where it did mark, it took; from face to footHe was a thing of blood, whose every motionWas timed with dying cries: alone he enter'dThe mortal gate of the city, which he paintedWith shunless destiny; aidless came off,And with a sudden reinforcement struckCorioli like a planet: now all's his:When, by and by, the din of war gan pierceHis ready sense; then straight his doubled spiritRe-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,And to the battle came he; where he didRun reeking o'er the lives of men, as if'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'dBoth field and city ours, he never stoodTo ease his breast with panting.Worthy man!He cannot but with measure fit the honoursWhich we devise him.Our spoils he kick'd at,And look'd upon things precious as they wereThe common muck of the world: he covets lessThan misery itself would give; rewardsHis deeds with doing them, and is contentTo spend the time to end it.He's right noble:Let him be call'd for.Call Coriolanus.He doth appear.The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleasedTo make thee consul.I do owe them stillMy life and services.It then remainsThat you do speak to the people.I do beseech you,Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannotPut on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please youThat I may pass this doing.Sir, the peopleMust have their voices; neither will they bateOne jot of ceremony.Put them not to't:Pray you, go fit you to the custom andTake to you, as your predecessors have,Your honour with your form.It is apartThat I shall blush in acting, and might wellBe taken from the people.Mark you that?To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,As if I had received them for the hireOf their breath only!Do not stand upon't.We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,Our purpose to them: and to our noble consulWish we all joy and honour.To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!You see how he intends to use the people.May they perceive's intent! He will require them,As if he did contemn what he requestedShould be in them to give.Come, we'll inform themOf our proceedings here: on the marketplace,I know, they do attend us.
