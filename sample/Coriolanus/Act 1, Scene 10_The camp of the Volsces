The town is ta'en!'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.Condition!I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!What good condition can a treaty findI' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounterAs often as we eat. By the elements,If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,He's mine, or I am his: mine emulationHath not that honour in't it had; for whereI thought to crush him in an equal force,True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some wayOr wrath or craft may get him.He's the devil.Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'dWith only suffering stain by him; for himShall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,Embarquements all of fury, shall lift upTheir rotten privilege and custom 'gainstMy hate to Marcius: where I find him, were itAt home, upon my brother's guard, even there,Against the hospitable canon, would IWash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that mustBe hostages for Rome.Will not you go?I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thitherHow the world goes, that to the pace of itI may spur on my journey.I shall, sir.
