Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:Deliver them this paper: having read it,Bid them repair to the market place; where I,Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuseThe city ports by this hath enter'd andIntends to appear before the people, hopingTo purge herself with words: dispatch.Most welcome!How is it with our general?Even soAs with a man by his own alms empoison'd,And with his charity slain.Most noble sir,If you do hold the same intent whereinYou wish'd us parties, we'll deliver youOf your great danger.Sir, I cannot tell:We must proceed as we do find the people.The people will remain uncertain whilst'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of eitherMakes the survivor heir of all.I know it;And my pretext to strike at him admitsA good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'dMine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,He bow'd his nature, never known beforeBut to be rough, unswayable and free.Sir, his stoutnessWhen he did stand for consul, which he lostBy lack of stooping,--That I would have spoke of:Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;Made him joint-servant with me; gave him wayIn all his own desires; nay, let him chooseOut of my files, his projects to accomplish,My best and freshest men; served his designmentsIn mine own person; holp to reap the fameWhich he did end all his; and took some prideTo do myself this wrong: till, at the last,I seem'd his follower, not partner, andHe waged me with his countenance, as ifI had been mercenary.So he did, my lord:The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,When he had carried Rome and that we look'dFor no less spoil than glory,--There was it:For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.At a few drops of women's rheum, which areAs cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labourOf our great action: therefore shall he die,And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!Your native town you enter'd like a post,And had no welcomes home: but he returns,Splitting the air with noise.And patient fools,Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tearWith giving him glory.Therefore, at your vantage,Ere he express himself, or move the peopleWith what he would say, let him feel your sword,Which we will second. When he lies along,After your way his tale pronounced shall buryHis reasons with his body.Say no more:Here come the lords.You are most welcome home.I have not deserved it.But, worthy lords, have you with heed perusedWhat I have written to you?We have.And grieve to hear't.What faults he made before the last, I thinkMight have found easy fines: but there to endWhere he was to begin and give awayThe benefit of our levies, answering usWith our own charge, making a treaty whereThere was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.He approaches: you shall hear him.Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,No more infected with my country's loveThan when I parted hence, but still subsistingUnder your great command. You are to knowThat prosperously I have attempted andWith bloody passage led your wars even toThe gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought homeDo more than counterpoise a full third partThe charges of the action. We have made peaceWith no less honour to the AntiatesThan shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,Together with the seal o' the senate, whatWe have compounded on.Read it not, noble lords;But tell the traitor, in the high'st degreeHe hath abused your powers.Traitor! how now!Ay, traitor, Marcius!Marcius!Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou thinkI'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n nameCoriolanus in Corioli?You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiouslyHe has betray'd your business, and given up,For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;Breaking his oath and resolution likeA twist of rotten silk, never admittingCounsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tearsHe whined and roar'd away your victory,That pages blush'd at him and men of heartLook'd wondering each at other.Hear'st thou, Mars?Name not the god, thou boy of tears!Ha!No more.Measureless liar, thou hast made my heartToo great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that everI was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; thatMust bear my beating to his grave--shall joinTo thrust the lie unto him.Peace, both, and hear me speak.Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, IFlutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:Alone I did it. Boy!Why, noble lords,Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,'Fore your own eyes and ears?Let him die for't.'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'dmy son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousinMarcus.' 'He killed my father.'Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!The man is noble and his fame folds-inThis orb o' the earth. His last offences to usShall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,And trouble not the peace.O that I had him,With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,To use my lawful sword!Insolent villain!Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!Hold, hold, hold, hold!My noble masters, hear me speak.O Tullus,--Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;Put up your swords.My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,Provoked by him, you cannot--the great dangerWhich this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoiceThat he is thus cut off. Please it your honoursTo call me to your senate, I'll deliverMyself your loyal servant, or endureYour heaviest censure.Bear from hence his body;And mourn you for him: let him be regardedAs the most noble corse that ever heraldDid follow to his urn.His own impatienceTakes from Aufidius a great part of blame.Let's make the best of it.My rage is gone;And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city heHath widow'd and unchilded many a one,Which to this hour bewail the injury,Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.
