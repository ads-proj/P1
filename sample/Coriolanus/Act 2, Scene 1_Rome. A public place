The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.Good or bad?Not according to the prayer of the people, for theylove not Marcius.Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.Pray you, who does the wolf love?The lamb.Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would thenoble Marcius.He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You twoare old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.Well, sir.In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you twohave not in abundance?He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.Especially in pride.And topping all others in boasting.This is strange now: do you two know how you arecensured here in the city, I mean of us o' theright-hand file? do you?Why, how are we censured?Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?Well, well, sir, well.Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief ofoccasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:give your dispositions the reins, and be angry atyour pleasures; at the least if you take it as apleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius forbeing proud?We do it not alone, sir.I know you can do very little alone; for your helpsare many, or else your actions would grow wondroussingle: your abilities are too infant-like fordoing much alone. You talk of pride: O that youcould turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,and make but an interior survey of your good selves!O that you could!What then, sir?Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, asany in Rome.Menenius, you are known well enough too.I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one thatloves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allayingTiber in't; said to be something imperfect infavouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-likeupon too trivial motion; one that converses morewith the buttock of the night than with the foreheadof the morning: what I think I utter, and spend mymalice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen asyou are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drinkyou give me touch my palate adversely, I make acrooked face at it. I can't say your worships havedelivered the matter well, when I find the ass incompound with the major part of your syllables: andthough I must be content to bear with those that sayyou are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly thattell you you have good faces. If you see this inthe map of my microcosm, follows it that I am knownwell enough too? what barm can your bissonconspectuities glean out of this character, if I beknown well enough too?Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. Youare ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: youwear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing acause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to asecond day of audience. When you are hearing amatter between party and party, if you chance to bepinched with the colic, you make faces likemummers; set up the bloody flag against allpatience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangledby your hearing: all the peace you make in theircause is, calling both the parties knaves. You area pair of strange ones.Come, come, you are well understood to be aperfecter giber for the table than a necessarybencher in the Capitol.Our very priests must become mockers, if they shallencounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. Whenyou speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth thewagging of your beards; and your beards deserve notso honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher'scushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessorssince Deucalion, though peradventure some of thebest of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den toyour worships: more of your conversation wouldinfect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastlyplebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you followyour eyes so fast?Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; forthe love of Juno, let's go.Ha! Marcius coming home!Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperousapprobation.Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!Marcius coming home!Nay,'tis true.Look, here's a letter from him: the state hathanother, his wife another; and, I think, there's oneat home for you.I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter forme!Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.A letter for me! it gives me an estate of sevenyears' health; in which time I will make a lip atthe physician: the most sovereign prescription inGalen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,of no better report than a horse-drench. Is henot wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.O, no, no, no.O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time homewith the oaken garland.Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, butAufidius got off.And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:an he had stayed by him, I would not have been sofidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the goldthat's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senatehas letters from the general, wherein he gives myson the whole name of the war: he hath in thisaction outdone his former deeds doublyIn troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without histrue purchasing.The gods grant them true!True! pow, wow.True! I'll be sworn they are true.Where is he wounded?God save your good worships! Marcius is cominghome: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will belarge cicatrices to show the people, when he shallstand for his place. He received in the repulse ofTarquin seven hurts i' the body.One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there'snine that I know.He had, before this last expedition, twenty-fivewounds upon him.Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.Hark! the trumpets.These are the ushers of Marcius: before him hecarries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fightWithin Corioli gates: where he hath won,With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; theseIn honour follows Coriolanus.Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!No more of this; it does offend my heart:Pray now, no more.Look, sir, your mother!O,You have, I know, petition'd all the godsFor my prosperity!Nay, my good soldier, up;My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, andBy deed-achieving honour newly named,--What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--But O, thy wife!My gracious silence, hail!Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,And mothers that lack sons.Now, the gods crown thee!And live you yet?O my sweet lady, pardon.I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weepAnd I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.A curse begin at very root on's heart,That is not glad to see thee! You are threeThat Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,We have some old crab-trees hereat home that will notBe grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:We call a nettle but a nettle andThe faults of fools but folly.Ever right.Menenius ever, ever.Give way there, and go on![To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA]  Your hand, and yours:Ere in our own house I do shade my head,The good patricians must be visited;From whom I have received not only greetings,But with them change of honours.I have livedTo see inherited my very wishesAnd the buildings of my fancy: onlyThere's one thing wanting, which I doubt not butOur Rome will cast upon thee.Know, good mother,I had rather be their servant in my way,Than sway with them in theirs.On, to the Capitol!All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sightsAre spectacled to see him: your prattling nurseInto a rapture lets her baby cryWhile she chats him: the kitchen malkin pinsHer richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsedWith variable complexions, all agreeingIn earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamensDo press among the popular throngs and puffTo win a vulgar station: or veil'd damesCommit the war of white and damask inTheir nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoilOf Phoebus' burning kisses: such a potherAs if that whatsoever god who leads himWere slily crept into his human powersAnd gave him graceful posture.On the sudden,I warrant him consul.Then our office may,During his power, go sleep.He cannot temperately transport his honoursFrom where he should begin and end, but willLose those he hath won.In that there's comfort.Doubt notThe commoners, for whom we stand, but theyUpon their ancient malice will forgetWith the least cause these his new honours, whichThat he will give them make I as little questionAs he is proud to do't.I heard him swear,Were he to stand for consul, never would heAppear i' the market-place nor on him putThe napless vesture of humility;Nor showing, as the manner is, his woundsTo the people, beg their stinking breaths.'Tis right.It was his word: O, he would miss it ratherThan carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,And the desire of the nobles.I wish no betterThan have him hold that purpose and to put itIn execution.'Tis most like he will.It shall be to him then as our good wills,A sure destruction.So it must fall outTo him or our authorities. For an end,We must suggest the people in what hatredHe still hath held them; that to's power he wouldHave made them mules, silenced their pleaders andDispropertied their freedoms, holding them,In human action and capacity,Of no more soul nor fitness for the worldThan camels in the war, who have their provandOnly for bearing burdens, and sore blowsFor sinking under them.This, as you say, suggestedAt some time when his soaring insolenceShall touch the people--which time shall not want,If he be put upon 't; and that's as easyAs to set dogs on sheep--will be his fireTo kindle their dry stubble; and their blazeShall darken him for ever.What's the matter?You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thoughtThat Marcius shall be consul:I have seen the dumb men throng to see him andThe blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,As to Jove's statue, and the commons madeA shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:I never saw the like.Let's to the Capitol;And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,But hearts for the event.Have with you.
