Wine, wine, wine! What serviceis here! I think our fellows are asleep.Where's Cotus? my master callsfor him. Cotus!A goodly house: the feast smells well; but IAppear not like a guest.What would you have, friend? whence are you?Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.I have deserved no better entertainment,In being Coriolanus.Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in hishead; that he gives entrance to such companions?Pray, get you out.Away!Away! get you away.Now thou'rt troublesome.Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.What fellow's this?A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get himout of the house: prithee, call my master to him.What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoidthe house.Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.What are you?A gentleman.A marvellous poor one.True, so I am.Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some otherstation; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what astrange guest he has here.And I shall.Where dwellest thou?Under the canopy.Under the canopy!Ay.Where's that?I' the city of kites and crows.I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!Then thou dwellest with daws too?No, I serve not thy master.How, sir! do you meddle with my master?Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thymistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thytrencher, hence!Where is this fellow?Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but fordisturbing the lords within.Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?If, Tullus,Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost notThink me for the man I am, necessityCommands me name myself.What is thy name?A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,And harsh in sound to thine.Say, what's thy name?Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy faceBears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?Prepare thy brow to frown: know'stthou me yet?I know thee not: thy name?My name is Caius Marcius, who hath doneTo thee particularly and to all the VolscesGreat hurt and mischief; thereto witness mayMy surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,The extreme dangers and the drops of bloodShed for my thankless country are requitedBut with that surname; a good memory,And witness of the malice and displeasureWhich thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;The cruelty and envy of the people,Permitted by our dastard nobles, whoHave all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to beWhoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremityHath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--Mistake me not--to save my life, for ifI had fear'd death, of all the men i' the worldI would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,To be full quit of those my banishers,Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hastA heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revengeThine own particular wrongs and stop those maimsOf shame seen through thy country, speedthee straight,And make my misery serve thy turn: so use itThat my revengeful services may proveAs benefits to thee, for I will fightAgainst my canker'd country with the spleenOf all the under fiends. But if so beThou darest not this and that to prove more fortunesThou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also amLonger to live most weary, and presentMy throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,And cannot live but to thy shame, unlessIt be to do thee service.O Marcius, Marcius!Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heartA root of ancient envy. If JupiterShould from yond cloud speak divine things,And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them moreThan thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twineMine arms about that body, where againstMy grained ash an hundred times hath brokeAnd scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clipThe anvil of my sword, and do contestAs hotly and as nobly with thy loveAs ever in ambitious strength I didContend against thy valour. Know thou first,I loved the maid I married; never manSigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heartThan when I first my wedded mistress sawBestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,We have a power on foot; and I had purposeOnce more to hew thy target from thy brawn,Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me outTwelve several times, and I have nightly sinceDreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;We have been down together in my sleep,Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but thatThou art thence banish'd, we would muster allFrom twelve to seventy, and pouring warInto the bowels of ungrateful Rome,Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,And take our friendly senators by the hands;Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,Who am prepared against your territories,Though not for Rome itself.You bless me, gods!Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt haveThe leading of thine own revenges, takeThe one half of my commission; and set down--As best thou art experienced, since thou know'stThy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,Or rudely visit them in parts remote,To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:Let me commend thee first to those that shallSay yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!And more a friend than e'er an enemy;Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!Here's a strange alteration!By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him witha cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made afalse report of him.What an arm he has! he turned me about with hisfinger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.Nay, I knew by his face that there was something inhim: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--Icannot tell how to term it.He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,but I thought there was more in him than I could think.So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarestman i' the world.I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.Who, my master?Nay, it's no matter for that.Worth six on him.Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be thegreater soldier.Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.Ay, and for an assault too.O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!What, what, what? let's partake.I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had aslieve be a condemned man.Wherefore? wherefore?Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,Caius Marcius.Why do you say 'thwack our general '?I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was alwaysgood enough for him.Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever toohard for him; I have heard him say so himself.He was too hard for him directly, to say the trothon't: before Corioli he scotched him and notchedhim like a carbon ado.An he had been cannibally given, he might havebroiled and eaten him too.But, more of thy news?Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were sonand heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; noquestion asked him by any of the senators, but theystand bald before him: our general himself makes amistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand andturns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. Butthe bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'the middle and but one half of what he wasyesterday; for the other has half, by the entreatyand grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: hewill mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has asmany friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as itwere, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, aswe term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.Directitude! what's that?But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,and the man in blood, they will out of theirburrows, like conies after rain, and revel all withhim.But when goes this forward?To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have thedrum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, aparcel of their feast, and to be executed ere theywipe their lips.Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increasetailors, and breed ballad-makers.Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far asday does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, andfull of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of morebastard children than war's a destroyer of men.'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said tobe a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is agreat maker of cuckolds.Ay, and it makes men hate one another.Reason; because they then less need one another.The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheapas Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.In, in, in, in!
