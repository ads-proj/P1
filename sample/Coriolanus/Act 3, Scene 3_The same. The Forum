In this point charge him home, that he affectsTyrannical power: if he evade us there,Enforce him with his envy to the people,And that the spoil got on the AntiatesWas ne'er distributed.What, will he come?He's coming.How accompanied?With old Menenius, and those senatorsThat always favour'd him.Have you a catalogueOf all the voices that we have procuredSet down by the poll?I have; 'tis ready.Have you collected them by tribes?I have.Assemble presently the people hither;And when they bear me say 'It shall be soI' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it eitherFor death, for fine, or banishment, then let themIf I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'Insisting on the old prerogativeAnd power i' the truth o' the cause.I shall inform them.And when such time they have begun to cry,Let them not cease, but with a din confusedEnforce the present executionOf what we chance to sentence.Very well.Make them be strong and ready for this hint,When we shall hap to give 't them.Go about it.Put him to choler straight: he hath been usedEver to conquer, and to have his worthOf contradiction: being once chafed, he cannotBe rein'd again to temperance; then he speaksWhat's in his heart; and that is there which looksWith us to break his neck.Well, here he comes.Calmly, I do beseech you.Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest pieceWill bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd godsKeep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justiceSupplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,And not our streets with war!Amen, amen.A noble wish.Draw near, ye people.List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!First, hear me speak.Well, say. Peace, ho!Shall I be charged no further than this present?Must all determine here?I do demand,If you submit you to the people's voices,Allow their officers and are contentTo suffer lawful censure for such faultsAs shall be proved upon you?I am content.Lo, citizens, he says he is content:The warlike service he has done, consider; thinkUpon the wounds his body bears, which showLike graves i' the holy churchyard.Scratches with briers,Scars to move laughter only.Consider further,That when he speaks not like a citizen,You find him like a soldier: do not takeHis rougher accents for malicious sounds,But, as I say, such as become a soldier,Rather than envy you.Well, well, no more.What is the matterThat being pass'd for consul with full voice,I am so dishonour'd that the very hourYou take it off again?Answer to us.Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.We charge you, that you have contrived to takeFrom Rome all season'd office and to windYourself into a power tyrannical;For which you are a traitor to the people.How! traitor!Nay, temperately; your promise.The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, inThy lying tongue both numbers, I would say'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as freeAs I do pray the gods.Mark you this, people?To the rock, to the rock with him!Peace!We need not put new matter to his charge:What you have seen him do and heard him speak,Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,Opposing laws with strokes and here defyingThose whose great power must try him; even this,So criminal and in such capital kind,Deserves the extremest death.But since he hathServed well for Rome,--What do you prate of service?I talk of that, that know it.You?Is this the promise that you made your mother?Know, I pray you,--I know no further:Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,Vagabond exile, raying, pent to lingerBut with a grain a day, I would not buyTheir mercy at the price of one fair word;Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'For that he has,As much as in him lies, from time to timeEnvied against the people, seeking meansTo pluck away their power, as now at lastGiven hostile strokes, and that not in the presenceOf dreaded justice, but on the ministersThat do distribute it; in the name o' the peopleAnd in the power of us the tribunes, we,Even from this instant, banish him our city,In peril of precipitationFrom off the rock Tarpeian never moreTo enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,I say it shall be so.It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:He's banish'd, and it shall be so.Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--He's sentenced; no more hearing.Let me speak:I have been consul, and can show for RomeHer enemies' marks upon me. I do loveMy country's good with a respect more tender,More holy and profound, than mine own life,My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,And treasure of my loins; then if I wouldSpeak that,--We know your drift: speak what?There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,As enemy to the people and his country:It shall be so.It shall be so, it shall be so.You common cry of curs! whose breath I hateAs reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prizeAs the dead carcasses of unburied menThat do corrupt my air, I banish you;And here remain with your uncertainty!Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,Fan you into despair! Have the power stillTo banish your defenders; till at lengthYour ignorance, which finds not till it feels,Making not reservation of yourselves,Still your own foes, deliver you as mostAbated captives to some nationThat won you without blows! Despising,For you, the city, thus I turn my back:There is a world elsewhere.The people's enemy is gone, is gone!Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,As he hath followed you, with all despite;Give him deserved vexation. Let a guardAttend us through the city.Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.
