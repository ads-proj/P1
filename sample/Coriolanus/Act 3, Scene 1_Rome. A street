Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?He had, my lord; and that it was which causedOur swifter composition.So then the Volsces stand but as at first,Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.Upon's again.They are worn, lord consul, so,That we shall hardly in our ages seeTheir banners wave again.Saw you Aufidius?On safe-guard he  came to me; and did curseAgainst the Volsces, for they had so vilelyYielded the town: he is retired to Antium.Spoke he of me?He did, my lord.How? what?How often he had met you, sword to sword;That of all things upon the earth he hatedYour person most, that he would pawn his fortunesTo hopeless restitution, so he mightBe call'd your vanquisher.At Antium lives he?At Antium.I wish I had a cause to seek him there,To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;For they do prank them in authority,Against all noble sufferance.Pass no further.Ha! what is that?It will be dangerous to go on: no further.What makes this change?The matter?Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?Cominius, no.Have I had children's voices?Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.The people are incensed against him.Stop,Or all will fall in broil.Are these your herd?Must these have voices, that can yield them nowAnd straight disclaim their tongues? What areyour offices?You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?Have you not set them on?Be calm, be calm.It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,To curb the will of the nobility:Suffer't, and live with such as cannot ruleNor ever will be ruled.Call't not a plot:The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,When corn was given them gratis, you repined;Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd themTime-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.Why, this was known before.Not to them all.Have you inform'd them sithence?How! I inform them!You are like to do such business.Not unlike,Each way, to better yours.Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,Let me deserve so ill as you, and make meYour fellow tribune.You show too much of thatFor which the people stir: if you will passTo where you are bound, you must inquire your way,Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,Or never be so noble as a consul,Nor yoke with him for tribune.Let's be calm.The people are abused; set on. This palteringBecomes not Rome, nor has CoriolanusDeserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falselyI' the plain way of his merit.Tell me of corn!This was my speech, and I will speak't again--Not now, not now.Not in this heat, sir, now.Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,I crave their pardons:For the mutable, rank-scented many, let themRegard me as I do not flatter, andTherein behold themselves: I say again,In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senateThe cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,and scatter'd,By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but thatWhich they have given to beggars.Well, no more.No more words, we beseech you.How! no more!As for my country I have shed my blood,Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungsCoin words till their decay against those measles,Which we disdain should tatter us, yet soughtThe very way to catch them.You speak o' the people,As if you were a god to punish, notA man of their infirmity.'Twere wellWe let the people know't.What, what? his choler?Choler!Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,By Jove, 'twould be my mind!It is a mindThat shall remain a poison where it is,Not poison any further.Shall remain!Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark youHis absolute 'shall'?'Twas from the canon.'Shall'!O good but most unwise patricians! why,You grave but reckless senators, have you thusGiven Hydra here to choose an officer,That with his peremptory 'shall,' being butThe horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spiritTo say he'll turn your current in a ditch,And make your channel his? If he have powerThen vail your ignorance; if none, awakeYour dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,Be not as common fools; if you are not,Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,If they be senators: and they are no less,When, both your voices blended, the great'st tasteMost palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'His popular 'shall' against a graver benchThan ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!It makes the consuls base: and my soul achesTo know, when two authorities are up,Neither supreme, how soon confusionMay enter 'twixt the gap of both and takeThe one by the other.Well, on to the market-place.Whoever gave that counsel, to give forthThe corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas usedSometime in Greece,--Well, well, no more of that.Though there the people had more absolute power,I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fedThe ruin of the state.Why, shall the people giveOne that speaks thus their voice?I'll give my reasons,More worthier than their voices. They know the cornWas not our recompense, resting well assuredThat ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,They would not thread the gates. This kind of serviceDid not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the warTheir mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'dMost valour, spoke not for them: the accusationWhich they have often made against the senate,All cause unborn, could never be the motiveOf our so frank donation. Well, what then?How shall this bisson multitude digestThe senate's courtesy? Let deeds expressWhat's like to be their words: 'we did request it;We are the greater poll, and in true fearThey gave us our demands.' Thus we debaseThe nature of our seats and make the rabbleCall our cares fears; which will in timeBreak ope the locks o' the senate and bring inThe crows to peck the eagles.Come, enough.Enough, with over-measure.No, take more:What may be sworn by, both divine and human,Seal what I end withal! This double worship,Where one part does disdain with cause, the otherInsult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,Cannot conclude but by the yea and noOf general ignorance,--it must omitReal necessities, and give way the whileTo unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,it follows,Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--You that will be less fearful than discreet,That love the fundamental part of stateMore than you doubt the change on't, that preferA noble life before a long, and wishTo jump a body with a dangerous physicThat's sure of death without it, at once pluck outThe multitudinous tongue; let them not lickThe sweet which is their poison: your dishonourMangles true judgment and bereaves the stateOf that integrity which should become't,Not having the power to do the good it would,For the in which doth control't.Has said enough.Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answerAs traitors do.Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!What should the people do with these bald tribunes?On whom depending, their obedience failsTo the greater bench: in a rebellion,When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,Then were they chosen: in a better hour,Let what is meet be said it must be meet,And throw their power i' the dust.Manifest treason!This a consul? no.The aediles, ho!Let him be apprehended.Go, call the people:in whose name myselfAttach thee as a traitorous innovator,A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,And follow to thine answer.Hence, old goat!Senators,  & C	We'll surety him.Aged sir, hands off.Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bonesOut of thy garments.Help, ye citizens!On both sides more respect.Here's he that would take from you all your power.Seize him, AEdiles!Down with him! down with him!Senators,  & C	Weapons, weapons, weapons!'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!''Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!''Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'What is about to be? I am out of breath;Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunesTo the people! Coriolanus, patience!Speak, good Sicinius.Hear me, people; peace!Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.You are at point to lose your liberties:Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,Whom late you have named for consul.Fie, fie, fie!This is the way to kindle, not to quench.To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.What is the city but the people?True,The people are the city.By the consent of all, we were establish'dThe people's magistrates.You so remain.And so are like to do.That is the way to lay the city flat;To bring the roof to the foundation,And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,In heaps and piles of ruin.This deserves death.Or let us stand to our authority,Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,Upon the part o' the people, in whose powerWe were elected theirs, Marcius is worthyOf present death.Therefore lay hold of him;Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thenceInto destruction cast him.AEdiles, seize him!Yield, Marcius, yield!Hear me one word;Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.Peace, peace![To BRUTUS]  Be that you seem, truly yourcountry's friend,And temperately proceed to what you wouldThus violently redress.Sir, those cold ways,That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonousWhere the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,And bear him to the rock.No, I'll die here.There's some among you have beheld me fighting:Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.Lay hands upon him.Help Marcius, help,You that be noble; help him, young and old!Down with him, down with him!Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!All will be naught else.Get you gone.Stand fast;We have as many friends as enemies.Sham it be put to that?The gods forbid!I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;Leave us to cure this cause.For 'tis a sore upon us,You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.Come, sir, along with us.I would they were barbarians--as they are,Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--Be gone;Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;One time will owe another.On fair groundI could beat forty of them.I could myselfTake up a brace o' the best of them; yea, thetwo tribunes:But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;And manhood is call'd foolery, when it standsAgainst a falling fabric. Will you hence,Before the tag return? whose rage doth rendLike interrupted waters and o'erbearWhat they are used to bear.Pray you, be gone:I'll try whether my old wit be in requestWith those that have but little: this must be patch'dWith cloth of any colour.Nay, come away.This man has marr'd his fortune.His nature is too noble for the world:He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;And, being angry, does forget that everHe heard the name of death.Here's goodly work!I would they were abed!I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!Could he not speak 'em fair?Where is this viperThat would depopulate the city andBe every man himself?You worthy tribunes,--He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rockWith rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,And therefore law shall scorn him further trialThan the severity of the public powerWhich he so sets at nought.He shall well knowThe noble tribunes are the people's mouths,And we their hands.He shall, sure on't.Sir, sir,--Peace!Do not cry havoc, where you should but huntWith modest warrant.Sir, how comes't that youHave holp to make this rescue?Hear me speak:As I do know the consul's worthiness,So can I name his faults,--Consul! what consul?The consul Coriolanus.He consul!No, no, no, no, no.If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;The which shall turn you to no further harmThan so much loss of time.Speak briefly then;For we are peremptory to dispatchThis viperous traitor: to eject him henceWere but one danger, and to keep him hereOur certain death: therefore it is decreedHe dies to-night.Now the good gods forbidThat our renowned Rome, whose gratitudeTowards her deserved children is enroll'dIn Jove's own book, like an unnatural damShould now eat up her own!He's a disease that must be cut away.O, he's a limb that has but a disease;Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;And what is left, to lose it by his country,Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,A brand to the end o' the world.This is clean kam.Merely awry: when he did love his country,It honour'd him.The service of the footBeing once gangrened, is not then respectedFor what before it was.We'll hear no more.Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:Lest his infection, being of catching nature,Spread further.One word more, one word.This tiger-footed rage, when it shall findThe harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too lateTie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,And sack great Rome with Romans.If it were so,--What do ye talk?Have we not had a taste of his obedience?Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.Consider this: he has been bred i' the warsSince he could draw a sword, and is ill school'dIn bolted language; meal and bran togetherHe throws without distinction. Give me leave,I'll go to him, and undertake to bring himWhere he shall answer, by a lawful form,In peace, to his utmost peril.Noble tribunes,It is the humane way: the other courseWill prove too bloody, and the end of itUnknown to the beginning.Noble Menenius,Be you then as the people's officer.Masters, lay down your weapons.Go not home.Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceedIn our first way.I'll bring him to you.Let me desire your company: he must come,Or what is worst will follow.Pray you, let's to him.
