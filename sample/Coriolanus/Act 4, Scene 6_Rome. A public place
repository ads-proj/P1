We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;His remedies are tame i' the present peaceAnd quietness of the people, which beforeWere in wild hurry. Here do we make his friendsBlush that the world goes well, who rather had,Though they themselves did suffer by't, beholdDissentious numbers pestering streets than seeOur tradesmen with in their shops and goingAbout their functions friendly.We stood to't in good time.Is this Menenius?'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.Hail sir!Hail to you both!Your CoriolanusIs not much miss'd, but with his friends:The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,Were he more angry at it.All's well; and might have been much better, ifHe could have temporized.Where is he, hear you?Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wifeHear nothing from him.The gods preserve you both!God-den, our neighbours.God-den to you all, god-den to you all.Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,Are bound to pray for you both.Live, and thrive!Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd CoriolanusHad loved you as we did.Now the gods keep you!Farewell, farewell.This is a happier and more comely timeThan when these fellows ran about the streets,Crying confusion.Caius Marcius wasA worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,Self-loving,--And affecting one sole throne,Without assistance.I think not so.We should by this, to all our lamentation,If he had gone forth consul, found it so.The gods have well prevented it, and RomeSits safe and still without him.Worthy tribunes,There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,Reports, the Volsces with two several powersAre enter'd in the Roman territories,And with the deepest malice of the warDestroy what lies before 'em.'Tis Aufidius,Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,And durst not once peep out.Come, what talk youOf Marcius?Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot beThe Volsces dare break with us.Cannot be!We have record that very well it can,And three examples of the like have beenWithin my age. But reason with the fellow,Before you punish him, where he heard this,Lest you shall chance to whip your informationAnd beat the messenger who bids bewareOf what is to be dreaded.Tell not me:I know this cannot be.Not possible.The nobles in great earnestness are goingAll to the senate-house: some news is comeThat turns their countenances.'Tis this slave;--Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;Nothing but his report.Yes, worthy sir,The slave's report is seconded; and more,More fearful, is deliver'd.What more fearful?It is spoke freely out of many mouths--How probable I do not know--that Marcius,Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,And vows revenge as spacious as betweenThe young'st and oldest thing.This is most likely!Raised only, that the weaker sort may wishGood Marcius home again.The very trick on't.This is unlikely:He and Aufidius can no more atoneThan violentest contrariety.You are sent for to the senate:A fearful army, led by Caius MarciusAssociated with Aufidius, ragesUpon our territories; and have alreadyO'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and tookWhat lay before them.O, you have made good work!What news? what news?You have holp to ravish your own daughters andTo melt the city leads upon your pates,To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--What's the news? what's the news?Your temples burned in their cement, andYour franchises, whereon you stood, confinedInto an auger's bore.Pray now, your news?You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--If!He is their god: he leads them like a thingMade by some other deity than nature,That shapes man better; and they follow him,Against us brats, with no less confidenceThan boys pursuing summer butterflies,Or butchers killing flies.You have made good work,You and your apron-men; you that stood so up muchon the voice of occupation andThe breath of garlic-eaters!He will shakeYour Rome about your ears.As HerculesDid shake down mellow fruit.You have made fair work!But is this true, sir?Ay; and you'll look paleBefore you find it other. All the regionsDo smilingly revolt; and who resistAre mock'd for valiant ignorance,And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?Your enemies and his find something in him.We are all undone, unlessThe noble man have mercy.Who shall ask it?The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the peopleDeserve such pity of him as the wolfDoes of the shepherds: for his best friends, if theyShould say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him evenAs those should do that had deserved his hate,And therein show'd like enemies.'Tis true:If he were putting to my house the brandThat should consume it, I have not the faceTo say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!You have broughtA trembling upon Rome, such as was neverSo incapable of help.Say not we brought it.How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beastsAnd cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,Who did hoot him out o' the city.But I fearThey'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,The second name of men, obeys his pointsAs if he were his officer: desperationIs all the policy, strength and defence,That Rome can make against them.Here come the clusters.And is Aufidius with him? You are theyThat made the air unwholesome, when you castYour stinking greasy caps in hooting atCoriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;And not a hair upon a soldier's headWhich will not prove a whip: as many coxcombsAs you threw caps up will he tumble down,And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;if he could burn us all into one coal,We have deserved it.Faith, we hear fearful news.For mine own part,When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.And so did I.And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did verymany of us: that we did, we did for the best; andthough we willingly consented to his banishment, yetit was against our will.Ye re goodly things, you voices!You have madeGood work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?O, ay, what else?Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:These are a side that would be glad to haveThis true which they so seem to fear. Go home,And show no sign of fear.The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banishedhim.So did we all. But, come, let's home.I do not like this news.Nor I.Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealthWould buy this for a lie!Pray, let us go.
