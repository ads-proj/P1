Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sidedIn his behalf.Now we have shown our power,Let us seem humbler after it is doneThan when it was a-doing.Bid them home:Say their great enemy is gone, and theyStand in their ancient strength.Dismiss them home.Here comes his mother.Let's not meet her.Why?They say she's mad.They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the godsRequite your love!Peace, peace; be not so loud.If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--Nay, and you shall hear some.Will you be gone?[To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too: I would I had the powerTo say so to my husband.Are  you mankind?Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxshipTo banish him that struck more blows for RomeThan thou hast spoken words?O blessed heavens!More noble blows than ever thou wise words;And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my sonWere in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,His good sword in his hand.What then?What then!He'ld make an end of thy posterity.Bastards and all.Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!Come, come, peace.I would he had continued to his countryAs he began, and not unknit himselfThe noble knot he made.I would he had.'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worthAs I can of those mysteries which heavenWill not have earth to know.Pray, let us go.Now, pray, sir, get you gone:You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--As far as doth the Capitol exceedThe meanest house in Rome, so far my son--This lady's husband here, this, do you see--Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.Well, well, we'll leave you.Why stay we to be baitedWith one that wants her wits?Take my prayers with you.I would the gods had nothing else to doBut to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'emBut once a-day, it would unclog my heartOf what lies heavy to't.You have told them home;And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.Fie, fie, fie!
