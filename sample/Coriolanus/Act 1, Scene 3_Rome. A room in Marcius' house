I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in amore comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, Ishould freelier rejoice in that absence wherein hewon honour than in the embracements of his bed wherehe would show most love. When yet he was buttender-bodied and the only son of my womb, whenyouth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, whenfor a day of kings' entreaties a mother should notsell him an hour from her beholding, I, consideringhow honour would become such a person. that it wasno better than picture-like to hang by the wall, ifrenown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seekdanger where he was like to find fame. To a cruelwar I sent him; from whence he returned, his browsbound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang notmore in joy at first hearing he was a man-childthan now in first seeing he had proved himself aman.But had he died in the business, madam; how then?Then his good report should have been my son; Itherein would have found issue. Hear me professsincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my lovealike and none less dear than thine and my goodMarcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for theircountry than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.Indeed, you shall not.Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody browWith his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mowOr all or lose his hire.His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!Away, you fool! it more becomes a manThan gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelierThan Hector's forehead when it spit forth bloodAt Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,We are fit to bid her welcome.Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his kneeAnd tread upon his neck.My ladies both, good day to you.Sweet madam.I am glad to see your ladyship.How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in goodfaith. How does your little son?I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, thanlook upon his school-master.O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis avery pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'Wednesday half an hour together: has such aconfirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gildedbutterfly: and when he caught it, he let it goagain; and after it again; and over and over hecomes, and again; catched it again; or whether hisfall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set histeeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammockedit!One on 's father's moods.Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.A crack, madam.Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you playthe idle husewife with me this afternoon.No, good madam; I will not out of doors.Not out of doors!She shall, she shall.Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over thethreshold till my lord return from the wars.Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,you must go visit the good lady that lies in.I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her withmy prayers; but I cannot go thither.Why, I pray you?'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, allthe yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fillIthaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambricwere sensible as your finger, that you might leavepricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell youexcellent news of your husband.O, good madam, there can be none yet.Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news fromhim last night.Indeed, madam?In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; againstwhom Cominius the general is gone, with one part ofour Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are setdown before their city Corioli; they nothing doubtprevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in everything hereafter.Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will butdisease our better mirth.In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thysolemness out o' door. and go along with us.No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wishyou much mirth.Well, then, farewell.
