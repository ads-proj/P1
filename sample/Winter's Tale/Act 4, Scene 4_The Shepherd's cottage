These your unusual weeds to each part of youDo give a life: no shepherdess, but FloraPeering in April's front. This your sheep-shearingIs as a meeting of the petty gods,And you the queen on't.Sir, my gracious lord,To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscuredWith a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feastsIn every mess have folly and the feedersDigest it with a custom, I should blushTo see you so attired, sworn, I think,To show myself a glass.I bless the timeWhen my good falcon made her flight acrossThy father's ground.Now Jove afford you cause!To me the difference forges dread; your greatnessHath not been used to fear. Even now I trembleTo think your father, by some accident,Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!How would he look, to see his work so nobleVilely bound up? What would he say? Or howShould I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, beholdThe sternness of his presence?ApprehendNothing but jollity. The gods themselves,Humbling their deities to love, have takenThe shapes of beasts upon them: JupiterBecame a bull, and bellow'd; the green NeptuneA ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,As I seem now. Their transformationsWere never for a piece of beauty rarer,Nor in a way so chaste, since my desiresRun not before mine honour, nor my lustsBurn hotter than my faith.O, but, sir,Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tisOpposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:One of these two must be necessities,Which then will speak, that you mustchange this purpose,Or I my life.Thou dearest Perdita,With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken notThe mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,Or not my father's. For I cannot beMine own, nor any thing to any, ifI be not thine. To this I am most constant,Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;Strangle such thoughts as these with any thingThat you behold the while. Your guests are coming:Lift up your countenance, as it were the dayOf celebration of that nuptial whichWe two have sworn shall come.O lady Fortune,Stand you auspicious!See, your guests approach:Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,And let's be red with mirth.Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, uponThis day she was both pantler, butler, cook,Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fireWith labour and the thing she took to quench it,She would to each one sip. You are retired,As if you were a feasted one and notThe hostess of the meeting: pray you, bidThese unknown friends to's welcome; for it isA way to make us better friends, more known.Come, quench your blushes and present yourselfThat which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,As your good flock shall prosper.[To POLIXENES]                  Sir, welcome:It is my father's will I should take on meThe hostess-ship o' the day.You're welcome, sir.Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,For you there's rosemary and rue; these keepSeeming and savour all the winter long:Grace and remembrance be to you both,And welcome to our shearing!Shepherdess,A fair one are you--well you fit our agesWith flowers of winter.Sir, the year growing ancient,Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birthOf trembling winter, the fairestflowers o' the seasonAre our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,Which some call nature's bastards: of that kindOur rustic garden's barren; and I care notTo get slips of them.Wherefore, gentle maiden,Do you neglect them?For I have heard it saidThere is an art which in their piedness sharesWith great creating nature.Say there be;Yet nature is made better by no meanBut nature makes that mean: so, over that artWhich you say adds to nature, is an artThat nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marryA gentler scion to the wildest stock,And make conceive a bark of baser kindBy bud of nobler race: this is an artWhich does mend nature, change it rather, butThe art itself is nature.So it is.Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,And do not call them bastards.I'll not putThe dibble in earth to set one slip of them;No more than were I painted I would wishThis youth should say 'twere well and only thereforeDesire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sunAnd with him rises weeping: these are flowersOf middle summer, and I think they are givenTo men of middle age. You're very welcome.I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,And only live by gazing.Out, alas!You'd be so lean, that blasts of JanuaryWould blow you through and through.Now, my fair'st friend,I would I had some flowers o' the spring that mightBecome your time of day; and yours, and yours,That wear upon your virgin branches yetYour maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fallFrom Dis's waggon! daffodils,That come before the swallow dares, and takeThe winds of March with beauty; violets dim,But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyesOr Cytherea's breath; pale primrosesThat die unmarried, ere they can beholdBight Phoebus in his strength--a maladyMost incident to maids; bold oxlips andThe crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,To strew him o'er and o'er!What, like a corse?No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:Methinks I play as I have seen them doIn Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mineDoes change my disposition.What you doStill betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish youA wave o' the sea, that you might ever doNothing but that; move still, still so,And own no other function: each your doing,So singular in each particular,Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,That all your acts are queens.O Doricles,Your praises are too large: but that your youth,And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,You woo'd me the false way.I think you haveAs little skill to fear as I have purposeTo put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,That never mean to part.I'll swear for 'em.This is the prettiest low-born lass that everRan on the green-sward: nothing she does or seemsBut smacks of something greater than herself,Too noble for this place.He tells her somethingThat makes her blood look out: good sooth, she isThe queen of curds and cream.Come on, strike up!Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,To mend her kissing with!Now, in good time!Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.Come, strike up!Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is thisWhich dances with your daughter?They call him Doricles; and boasts himselfTo have a worthy feeding: but I have itUpon his own report and I believe it;He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:I think so too; for never gazed the moonUpon the water as he'll stand and readAs 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.I think there is not half a kiss to chooseWho loves another best.She dances featly.So she does any thing; though I report it,That should be silent: if young DoriclesDo light upon her, she shall bring him thatWhich he not dreams of.O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at thedoor, you would never dance again after a tabour andpipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he singsseveral tunes faster than you'll tell money; heutters them as he had eaten ballads and all men'sears grew to his tunes.He could never come better; he shall come in. Ilove a ballad but even too well, if it be dolefulmatter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thingindeed and sung lamentably.He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; nomilliner can so fit his customers with gloves: hehas the prettiest love-songs for maids; so withoutbawdry, which is strange; with such delicateburthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thumpher;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap intothe matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do meno harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'This is a brave fellow.Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceitedfellow. Has he any unbraided wares?He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia canlearnedly handle, though they come to him by thegross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, hesings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; youwould think a smock were a she-angel, he so chantsto the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.You have of these pedlars, that have more in themthan you'ld think, sister.Ay, good brother, or go about to think.Lawn as white as driven snow;Cyprus black as e'er was crow;Gloves as sweet as damask roses;Masks for faces and for noses;Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,Perfume for a lady's chamber;Golden quoifs and stomachers,For my lads to give their dears:Pins and poking-sticks of steel,What maids lack from head to heel:Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst takeno money of me; but being enthralled as I am, itwill also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.I was promised them against the feast; but they comenot too late now.He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he haspaid you more, which will shame you to give him again.Is there no manners left among maids? will theywear their plackets where they should bear theirfaces? Is there not milking-time, when you aregoing to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off thesesecrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before allour guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamouryour tongues, and not a word more.I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-laceand a pair of sweet gloves.Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the wayand lost all my money?And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;therefore it behoves men to be wary.Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.What hast here? ballads?Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'life, for then we are sure they are true.Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer'swife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at aburthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads andtoads carbonadoed.Is it true, think you?Very true, and but a month old.Bless me from marrying a usurer!Here's the midwife's name to't, one MistressTale-porter, and five or six honest wives that werepresent. Why should I carry lies abroad?Pray you now, buy it.Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moeballads; we'll buy the other things anon.Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared uponthe coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,forty thousand fathom above water, and sung thisballad against the hard hearts of maids: it wasthought she was a woman and was turned into a coldfish for she would not exchange flesh with one thatloved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.Is it true too, think you?Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more thanmy pack will hold.Lay it by too: another.This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.Let's have some merry ones.Why, this is a passing merry one and goes tothe tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there'sscarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis inrequest, I can tell you.We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thoushalt hear; 'tis in three parts.We had the tune on't a month ago.I can bear my part; you must know 'tis myoccupation; have at it with you.Get you hence, for I must goWhere it fits not you to know.Whither?O, whither?Whither?It becomes thy oath full well,Thou to me thy secrets tell.Me too, let me go thither.Or thou goest to the orange or mill.If to either, thou dost ill.Neither.What, neither?Neither.Thou hast sworn my love to be.Thou hast sworn it more to me:Then whither goest? say, whither?We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: myfather and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'llnot trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack afterme. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let'shave the first choice. Follow me, girls.And you shall pay well for 'em.Will you buy any tape,Or lace for your cape,My dainty duck, my dear-a?Any silk, any thread,Any toys for your head,Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?Come to the pedlar;Money's a medler.That doth utter all men's ware-a.Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have madethemselves all men of hair, they call themselvesSaltiers, and they have a dance which the wenchessay is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they arenot in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if itbe not too rough for some that know little butbowling, it will please plentifully.Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too muchhomely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's seethese four threes of herdsmen.One three of them, by their own report, sir, hathdanced before the king; and not the worst of thethree but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.Leave your prating: since these good men arepleased, let them come in; but quickly now.Why, they stay at door, sir.O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.He's simple and tells much.How now, fair shepherd!Your heart is full of something that does takeYour mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was youngAnd handed love as you do, I was wontTo load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'dThe pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd itTo her acceptance; you have let him goAnd nothing marted with him. If your lassInterpretation should abuse and call thisYour lack of love or bounty, you were straitedFor a reply, at least if you make a careOf happy holding her.Old sir, I knowShe prizes not such trifles as these are:The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'dUp in my heart; which I have given already,But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my lifeBefore this ancient sir, who, it should seem,Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,As soft as dove's down and as white as it,Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'dsnow that's boltedBy the northern blasts twice o'er.What follows this?How prettily the young swain seems to washThe hand was fair before! I have put you out:But to your protestation; let me hearWhat you profess.Do, and be witness to 't.And this my neighbour too?And he, and moreThan he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youthThat ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledgeMore than was ever man's, I would not prize themWithout her love; for her employ them all;Commend them and condemn them to her serviceOr to their own perdition.Fairly offer'd.This shows a sound affection.But, my daughter,Say you the like to him?I cannot speakSo well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut outThe purity of his.Take hands, a bargain!And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:I give my daughter to him, and will makeHer portion equal his.O, that must beI' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,I shall have more than you can dream of yet;Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,Contract us 'fore these witnesses.Come, your hand;And, daughter, yours.Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;Have you a father?I have: but what of him?Knows he of this?He neither does nor shall.Methinks a fatherIs at the nuptial of his son a guestThat best becomes the table. Pray you once more,Is not your father grown incapableOf reasonable affairs? is he not stupidWith age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?Know man from man? dispute his own estate?Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothingBut what he did being childish?No, good sir;He has his health and ampler strength indeedThan most have of his age.By my white beard,You offer him, if this be so, a wrongSomething unfilial: reason my sonShould choose himself a wife, but as good reasonThe father, all whose joy is nothing elseBut fair posterity, should hold some counselIn such a business.I yield all this;But for some other reasons, my grave sir,Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaintMy father of this business.Let him know't.He shall not.Prithee, let him.No, he must not.Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieveAt knowing of thy choice.Come, come, he must not.Mark our contract.Mark your divorce, young sir,Whom son I dare not call; thou art too baseTo be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,I am sorry that by hanging thee I canBut shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh pieceOf excellent witchcraft, who of force must knowThe royal fool thou copest with,--O, my heart!I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and madeMore homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,If I may ever know thou dost but sighThat thou no more shalt see this knack, as neverI mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,Though full of our displeasure, yet we free theeFrom the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,That makes himself, but for our honour therein,Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thouThese rural latches to his entrance open,Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,I will devise a death as cruel for theeAs thou art tender to't.Even here undone!I was not much afeard; for once or twiceI was about to speak and tell him plainly,The selfsame sun that shines upon his courtHides not his visage from our cottage butLooks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?I told you what would come of this: beseech you,Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,But milk my ewes and weep.Why, how now, father!Speak ere thou diest.I cannot speak, nor thinkNor dare to know that which I know. O sir!You have undone a man of fourscore three,That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,To die upon the bed my father died,To lie close by his honest bones: but nowSome hangman must put on my shroud and lay meWhere no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,That knew'st this was the prince,and wouldst adventureTo mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!If I might die within this hour, I have livedTo die when I desire.Why look you so upon me?I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;More straining on for plucking back, not followingMy leash unwillingly.Gracious my lord,You know your father's temper: at this timeHe will allow no speech, which I do guessYou do not purpose to him; and as hardlyWill he endure your sight as yet, I fear:Then, till the fury of his highness settle,Come not before him.I not purpose it.I think, Camillo?Even he, my lord.How often have I told you 'twould be thus!How often said, my dignity would lastBut till 'twere known!It cannot fail but byThe violation of my faith; and thenLet nature crush the sides o' the earth togetherAnd mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:From my succession wipe me, father; IAm heir to my affection.Be advised.I am, and by my fancy: if my reasonWill thereto be obedient, I have reason;If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,Do bid it welcome.This is desperate, sir.So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that mayBe thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees orThe close earth wombs or the profound sea hidesIn unknown fathoms, will I break my oathTo this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean notTo see him any more,--cast your good counselsUpon his passion; let myself and fortuneTug for the time to come. This you may knowAnd so deliver, I am put to seaWith her whom here I cannot hold on shore;And most opportune to our need I haveA vessel rides fast by, but not preparedFor this design. What course I mean to holdShall nothing benefit your knowledge, norConcern me the reporting.O my lord!I would your spirit were easier for advice,Or stronger for your need.Hark, PerditaI'll hear you by and by.He's irremoveable,Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, ifHis going I could frame to serve my turn,Save him from danger, do him love and honour,Purchase the sight again of dear SiciliaAnd that unhappy king, my master, whomI so much thirst to see.Now, good Camillo;I am so fraught with curious business thatI leave out ceremony.Sir, I thinkYou have heard of my poor services, i' the loveThat I have borne your father?Very noblyHave you deserved: it is my father's musicTo speak your deeds, not little of his careTo have them recompensed as thought on.Well, my lord,If you may please to think I love the kingAnd through him what is nearest to him, which isYour gracious self, embrace but my direction:If your more ponderous and settled projectMay suffer alteration, on mine honour,I'll point you where you shall have such receivingAs shall become your highness; where you mayEnjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,There's no disjunction to be made, but by--As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,And, with my best endeavours in your absence,Your discontenting father strive to qualifyAnd bring him up to liking.How, Camillo,May this, almost a miracle, be done?That I may call thee something more than manAnd after that trust to thee.Have you thought onA place whereto you'll go?Not any yet:But as the unthought-on accident is guiltyTo what we wildly do, so we professOurselves to be the slaves of chance and fliesOf every wind that blows.Then list to me:This follows, if you will not change your purposeBut undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,And there present yourself and your fair princess,For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:She shall be habited as it becomesThe partner of your bed. Methinks I seeLeontes opening his free arms and weepingHis welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the handsOf your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the oneHe chides to hell and bids the other growFaster than thought or time.Worthy Camillo,What colour for my visitation shall IHold up before him?Sent by the king your fatherTo greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,The manner of your bearing towards him, withWhat you as from your father shall deliver,Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:The which shall point you forth at every sittingWhat you must say; that he shall not perceiveBut that you have your father's bosom thereAnd speak his very heart.I am bound to you:There is some sap in this.A cause more promisingThan a wild dedication of yourselvesTo unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certainTo miseries enough; no hope to help you,But as you shake off one to take another;Nothing so certain as your anchors, whoDo their best office, if they can but stay youWhere you'll be loath to be: besides you knowProsperity's the very bond of love,Whose fresh complexion and whose heart togetherAffliction alters.One of these is true:I think affliction may subdue the cheek,But not take in the mind.Yea, say you so?There shall not at your father's house theseseven yearsBe born another such.My good Camillo,She is as forward of her breeding asShe is i' the rear our birth.I cannot say 'tis pityShe lacks instructions, for she seems a mistressTo most that teach.Your pardon, sir; for thisI'll blush you thanks.My prettiest Perdita!But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,Preserver of my father, now of me,The medicine of our house, how shall we do?We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,Nor shall appear in Sicilia.My lord,Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunesDo all lie there: it shall be so my careTo have you royally appointed as ifThe scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,That you may know you shall not want, one word.Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, hissworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have soldall my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not aribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,to keep my pack from fasting: they throng whoshould buy first, as if my trinkets had beenhallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:by which means I saw whose purse was best inpicture; and what I saw, to my good use Iremembered. My clown, who wants but something tobe a reasonable man, grew so in love with thewenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoestill he had both tune and words; which so drew therest of the herd to me that all their other sensesstuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, itwas senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of apurse; I could have filed keys off that hung inchains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,and admiring the nothing of it. So that in thistime of lethargy I picked and cut most of theirfestival purses; and had not the old man come inwith a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king'sson and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had notleft a purse alive in the whole army.Nay, but my letters, by this means being thereSo soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--Shall satisfy your father.Happy be you!All that you speak shows fair.Who have we here?We'll make an instrument of this, omitNothing may give us aid.If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fearnot, man; here's no harm intended to thee.I am a poor fellow, sir.Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that fromthee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we mustmake an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--andchange garments with this gentleman: though thepennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,there's some boot.I am a poor fellow, sir.I know ye well enough.Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is halfflayed already.Are you in earnest, sir?I smell the trick on't.Dispatch, I prithee.Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot withconscience take it.Unbuckle, unbuckle.Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecyCome home to ye!--you must retire yourselfInto some covert: take your sweetheart's hatAnd pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,Dismantle you, and, as you can, dislikenThe truth of your own seeming; that you may--For I do fear eyes over--to shipboardGet undescried.I see the play so liesThat I must bear a part.No remedy.Have you done there?Should I now meet my father,He would not call me son.Nay, you shall have no hat.Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.Adieu, sir.O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!Pray you, a word.[Aside]  What I do next, shall be to tell the kingOf this escape and whither they are bound;Wherein my hope is I shall so prevailTo force him after: in whose companyI shall review Sicilia, for whose sightI have a woman's longing.Fortune speed us!Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.The swifter speed the better.I understand the business, I hear it: to have anopen ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, isnecessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisitealso, to smell out work for the other senses. I seethis is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.What an exchange had this been without boot! Whata boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods dothis year connive at us, and we may do any thingextempore. The prince himself is about a piece ofiniquity, stealing away from his father with hisclog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece ofhonesty to acquaint the king withal, I would notdo't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;and therein am I constant to my profession.Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:every lane's end, every shop, church, session,hanging, yields a careful man work.See, see; what a man you are now!There is no other way but to tell the kingshe's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.Nay, but hear me.Nay, but hear me.Go to, then.She being none of your flesh and blood, your fleshand blood has not offended the king; and so yourflesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Showthose things you found about her, those secretthings, all but what she has with her: this beingdone, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and hisson's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,neither to his father nor to me, to go about to makeme the king's brother-in-law.Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off youcould have been to him and then your blood had beenthe dearer by I know how much an ounce.[Aside]  Very wisely, puppies!Well, let us to the king: there is that in thisfardel will make him scratch his beard.[Aside]  I know not what impediment this complaintmay be to the flight of my master.Pray heartily he be at palace.[Aside]  Though I am not naturally honest, I am sosometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.How now, rustics! whither are you bound?To the palace, an it like your worship.Your affairs there, what, with whom, the conditionof that fardel, the place of your dwelling, yournames, your ages, of what having, breeding, and anything that is fitting to be known, discover.We are but plain fellows, sir.A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have nolying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and theyoften give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them forit with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; thereforethey do not give us the lie.Your worship had like to have given us one, if youhad not taken yourself with the manner.Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seestthou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect Inot on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thybusiness, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtiercap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluckback thy business there: whereupon I command thee toopen thy affair.My business, sir, is to the king.What advocate hast thou to him?I know not, an't like you.Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say youhave none.None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.How blessed are we that are not simple men!Yet nature might have made me as these are,Therefore I will not disdain.This cannot be but a great courtier.His garments are rich, but he wearsthem not handsomely.He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the pickingon's teeth.The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?Wherefore that box?Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,which none must know but the king; and which heshall know within this hour, if I may come to thespeech of him.Age, thou hast lost thy labour.Why, sir?The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard anew ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,if thou beest capable of things serious, thou mustknow the king is full of grief.So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should havemarried a shepherd's daughter.If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:the curses he shall have, the tortures he shallfeel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.Think you so, sir?Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavyand vengeance bitter; but those that are germane tohim, though removed fifty times, shall all comeunder the hangman: which though it be great pity,yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue aram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come intograce! Some say he shall be stoned; but that deathis too soft for him, say I	draw our throne into asheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an'tlike you, sir?He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then'nointed over with honey, set on the head of awasp's nest; then stand till he be three quartersand a dram dead; then recovered again withaqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw ashe is, and in the hottest day prognosticationproclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, thesun looking with a southward eye upon him, where heis to behold him with flies blown to death. But whattalk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseriesare to be smiled at, their offences being socapital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plainmen, what you have to the king: being somethinggently considered, I'll bring you where he isaboard, tender your persons to his presence,whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in manbesides the king to effect your suits, here is manshall do it.He seems to be of great authority: close with him,give him gold; and though authority be a stubbornbear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: showthe inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'An't please you, sir, to undertake the business forus, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as muchmore and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.After I have done what I promised?Ay, sir.Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitifulone, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,he'll be made an example.Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and showour strange sights: he must know 'tis none of yourdaughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, Iwill give you as much as this old man does when thebusiness is performed, and remain, as he says, yourpawn till it be brought you.I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;go on the right hand: I will but look upon thehedge and follow you.We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune wouldnot suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I amcourted now with a double occasion, gold and a meansto do the prince my master good; which who knows howthat may turn back to my advancement? I will bringthese two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if hethink it fit to shore them again and that thecomplaint they have to the king concerns himnothing, let him call me rogue for being so farofficious; for I am proof against that title andwhat shame else belongs to't. To him will I presentthem: there may be matter in it.
