If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, onthe like occasion whereon my services are now onfoot, you shall see, as I have said, greatdifference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.I think, this coming summer, the King of Siciliameans to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will bejustified in our loves; for indeed--Beseech you,--Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I knownot what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuseus.You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs meand as mine honesty puts it to utterance.Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.They were trained together in their childhoods; andthere rooted betwixt them then such an affection,which cannot choose but branch now. Since theirmore mature dignities and royal necessities madeseparation of their society, their encounters,though not personal, have been royally attorneyedwith interchange of gifts, letters, lovingembassies; that they have seemed to be together,though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, andembraced, as it were, from the ends of opposedwinds. The heavens continue their loves!I think there is not in the world either malice ormatter to alter it. You have an unspeakablecomfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is agentleman of the greatest promise that ever cameinto my note.I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: itis a gallant child; one that indeed physics thesubject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went oncrutches ere he was born desire yet their life tosee him a man.Would they else be content to die?Yes; if there were no other excuse why they shoulddesire to live.If the king had no son, they would desire to liveon crutches till he had one.
