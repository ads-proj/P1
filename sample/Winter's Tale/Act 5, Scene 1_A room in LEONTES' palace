Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'dA saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid downMore penitence than done trespass: at the last,Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;With them forgive yourself.Whilst I rememberHer and her virtues, I cannot forgetMy blemishes in them, and so still think ofThe wrong I did myself; which was so much,That heirless it hath made my kingdom andDestroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er manBred his hopes out of.True, too true, my lord:If, one by one, you wedded all the world,Or from the all that are took something good,To make a perfect woman, she you kill'dWould be unparallel'd.I think so. Kill'd!She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest meSorely, to say I did; it is as bitterUpon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,Say so but seldom.Not at all, good lady:You might have spoken a thousand things that wouldHave done the time more benefit and gracedYour kindness better.You are one of thoseWould have him wed again.If you would not so,You pity not the state, nor the remembranceOf his most sovereign name; consider littleWhat dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,May drop upon his kingdom and devourIncertain lookers on. What were more holyThan to rejoice the former queen is well?What holier than, for royalty's repair,For present comfort and for future good,To bless the bed of majesty againWith a sweet fellow to't?There is none worthy,Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the godsWill have fulfill'd their secret purposes;For has not the divine Apollo said,Is't not the tenor of his oracle,That King Leontes shall not have an heirTill his lost child be found? which that it shall,Is all as monstrous to our human reasonAs my Antigonus to break his graveAnd come again to me; who, on my life,Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counselMy lord should to the heavens be contrary,Oppose against their wills.Care not for issue;The crown will find an heir: great AlexanderLeft his to the worthiest; so his successorWas like to be the best.Good Paulina,Who hast the memory of Hermione,I know, in honour, O, that ever IHad squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,Have taken treasure from her lips--And left themMore rich for what they yielded.Thou speak'st truth.No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,And better used, would make her sainted spiritAgain possess her corpse, and on this stage,Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,And begin, 'Why to me?'Had she such power,She had just cause.She had; and would incense meTo murder her I married.I should so.Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you markHer eye, and tell me for what dull part in'tYou chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your earsShould rift to hear me; and the words that follow'dShould be 'Remember mine.'Stars, stars,And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;I'll have no wife, Paulina.Will you swearNever to marry but by my free leave?Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.You tempt him over-much.Unless another,As like Hermione as is her picture,Affront his eye.Good madam,--I have done.Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,No remedy, but you will,--give me the officeTo choose you a queen: she shall not be so youngAs was your former; but she shall be suchAs, walk'd your first queen's ghost,it should take joyTo see her in your arms.My true Paulina,We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.ThatShall be when your first queen's again in breath;Never till then.One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,Son of Polixenes, with his princess, sheThe fairest I have yet beheld, desires accessTo your high presence.What with him? he comes notLike to his father's greatness: his approach,So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us'Tis not a visitation framed, but forcedBy need and accident. What train?But few,And those but mean.His princess, say you, with him?Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,That e'er the sun shone bright on.O Hermione,As every present time doth boast itselfAbove a better gone, so must thy graveGive way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourselfHave said and writ so, but your writing nowIs colder than that theme, 'She had not been,Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verseFlow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,To say you have seen a better.Pardon, madam:The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,Would she begin a sect, might quench the zealOf all professors else, make proselytesOf who she but bid follow.How! not women?Women will love her, that she is a womanMore worth than any man; men, that she isThe rarest of all women.Go, Cleomenes;Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strangeHe thus should steal upon us.Had our prince,Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'dWell with this lord: there was not full a monthBetween their births.Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'stHe dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,When I shall see this gentleman, thy speechesWill bring me to consider that which mayUnfurnish me of reason. They are come.Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;For she did print your royal father off,Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,Your father's image is so hit in you,His very air, that I should call you brother,As I did him, and speak of something wildlyBy us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earthMight thus have stood begetting wonder asYou, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--All mine own folly--the society,Amity too, of your brave father, whom,Though bearing misery, I desire my lifeOnce more to look on him.By his commandHave I here touch'd Sicilia and from himGive you all greetings that a king, at friend,Can send his brother: and, but infirmityWhich waits upon worn times hath something seizedHis wish'd ability, he had himselfThe lands and waters 'twixt your throne and hisMeasured to look upon you; whom he loves--He bade me say so--more than all the sceptresAnd those that bear them living.O my brother,Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stirAfresh within me, and these thy offices,So rarely kind, are as interpretersOf my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,As is the spring to the earth. And hath he tooExposed this paragon to the fearful usage,At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,To greet a man not worth her pains, much lessThe adventure of her person?Good my lord,She came from Libya.Where the warlike Smalus,That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughterHis tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,To execute the charge my father gave meFor visiting your highness: my best trainI have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;Who for Bohemia bend, to signifyNot only my success in Libya, sir,But my arrival and my wife's in safetyHere where we are.The blessed godsPurge all infection from our air whilst youDo climate here! You have a holy father,A graceful gentleman; against whose person,So sacred as it is, I have done sin:For which the heavens, taking angry note,Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,As he from heaven merits it, with youWorthy his goodness. What might I have been,Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,Such goodly things as you!Most noble sir,That which I shall report will bear no credit,Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,Bohemia greets you from himself by me;Desires you to attach his son, who has--His dignity and duty both cast off--Fled from his father, from his hopes, and withA shepherd's daughter.Where's Bohemia? speak.Here in your city; I now came from him:I speak amazedly; and it becomesMy marvel and my message. To your courtWhiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,Of this fair couple, meets he on the wayThe father of this seeming lady andHer brother, having both their country quittedWith this young prince.Camillo has betray'd me;Whose honour and whose honesty till nowEndured all weathers.Lay't so to his charge:He's with the king your father.Who? Camillo?Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who nowHas these poor men in question. Never saw IWretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;Forswear themselves as often as they speak:Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens themWith divers deaths in death.O my poor father!The heaven sets spies upon us, will not haveOur contract celebrated.You are married?We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:The odds for high and low's alike.My lord,Is this the daughter of a king?She is,When once she is my wife.That 'once' I see by your good father's speedWill come on very slowly. I am sorry,Most sorry, you have broken from his likingWhere you were tied in duty, and as sorryYour choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,That you might well enjoy her.Dear, look up:Though Fortune, visible an enemy,Should chase us with my father, power no jotHath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,Remember since you owed no more to timeThan I do now: with thought of such affections,Step forth mine advocate; at your requestMy father will grant precious things as trifles.Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,Which he counts but a trifle.Sir, my liege,Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazesThan what you look on now.I thought of her,Even in these looks I made.But your petitionIs yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,I am friend to them and you: upon which errandI now go toward him; therefore follow meAnd mark what way I make: come, good my lord.
