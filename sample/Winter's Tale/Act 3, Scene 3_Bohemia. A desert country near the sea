Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd uponThe deserts of Bohemia?Ay, my lord: and fearWe have landed in ill time: the skies look grimlyAnd threaten present blusters. In my conscience,The heavens with that we have in hand are angryAnd frown upon 's.Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;Look to thy bark: I'll not be long beforeI call upon thee.Make your best haste, and go notToo far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;Besides, this place is famous for the creaturesOf prey that keep upon't.Go thou away:I'll follow instantly.I am glad at heartTo be so rid o' the business.Come, poor babe:I have heard, but not believed,the spirits o' the deadMay walk again: if such thing be, thy motherAppear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dreamSo like a waking. To me comes a creature,Sometimes her head on one side, some another;I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,Like very sanctity, she did approachMy cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,And gasping to begin some speech, her eyesBecame two spouts: the fury spent, anonDid this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,Since fate, against thy better disposition,Hath made thy person for the thrower-outOf my poor babe, according to thine oath,Places remote enough are in Bohemia,There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babeIs counted lost for ever, Perdita,I prithee, call't. For this ungentle businessPut on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt seeThy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieksShe melted into air. Affrighted much,I did in time collect myself and thoughtThis was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,I will be squared by this. I do believeHermione hath suffer'd death, and thatApollo would, this being indeed the issueOf King Polixenes, it should here be laid,Either for life or death, upon the earthOf its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!There lie, and there thy character: there these;Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,That for thy mother's fault art thus exposedTo loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am ITo be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to haveA lullaby too rough: I never sawThe heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:I am gone for ever.I would there were no age between sixteen andthree-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out therest; for there is nothing in the between butgetting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any butthese boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twentyhunt this weather? They have scared away two of mybest sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner findthan the master: if any where I have them, 'tis bythe seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thywill what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a verypretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? Apretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:though I am not bookish, yet I can readwaiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has beensome stair-work, some trunk-work, somebehind-door-work: they were warmer that got thisthan the poor thing is here. I'll take it up forpity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooedbut even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!Hilloa, loa!What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talkon when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. Whatailest thou, man?I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now thesky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrusta bodkin's point.Why, boy, how is it?I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,how it takes up the shore! but that's not thepoint. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now theship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anonswallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust acork into a hogshead. And then for theland-service, to see how the bear tore out hisshoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and saidhis name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make anend of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragonedit: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and thesea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roaredand the bear mocked him, both roaring louder thanthe sea or weather.Name of mercy, when was this, boy?Now, now: I have not winked since I saw thesesights: the men are not yet cold under water, northe bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at itnow.Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!I would you had been by the ship side, to havehelped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with thingsdying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight forthee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire'schild! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should berich by the fairies. This is some changeling:open't. What's within, boy?You're a made old man: if the sins of your youthare forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: upwith't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requiresnothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, goodboy, the next way home.Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go seeif the bear be gone from the gentleman and how muchhe hath eaten: they are never curst but when theyare hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll buryit.That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by thatwhich is left of him what he is, fetch me to thesight of him.Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.SCENE I:I, that please some, try all, both joy and terrorOf good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,Now take upon me, in the name of Time,To use my wings. Impute it not a crimeTo me or my swift passage, that I slideO'er sixteen years and leave the growth untriedOf that wide gap, since it is in my powerTo o'erthrow law and in one self-born hourTo plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me passThe same I am, ere ancient'st order wasOr what is now received: I witness toThe times that brought them in; so shall I doTo the freshest things now reigning and make staleThe glistering of this present, as my taleNow seems to it. Your patience this allowing,I turn my glass and give my scene such growingAs you had slept between: Leontes leaving,The effects of his fond jealousies so grievingThat he shuts up himself, imagine me,Gentle spectators, that I now may beIn fair Bohemia, and remember well,I mentioned a son o' the king's, which FlorizelI now name to you; and with speed so paceTo speak of Perdita, now grown in graceEqual with wondering: what of her ensuesI list not prophecy; but let Time's newsBe known when 'tis brought forth.A shepherd's daughter,And what to her adheres, which follows after,Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,If ever you have spent time worse ere now;If never, yet that Time himself doth sayHe wishes earnestly you never may.
