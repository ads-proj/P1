Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?Ay, what else? and but I be deceivedSignior Baptista may remember me,Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.I warrant you.But, sir, here comes your boy;'Twere good he were school'd.Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.Tut, fear not me.But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?I told him that your father was at Venice,And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.Signior Baptista, you are happily met.Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:I pray you stand good father to me now,Give me Bianca for my patrimony.Soft son!Sir, by your leave: having come to PaduaTo gather in some debts, my son LucentioMade me acquainted with a weighty causeOf love between your daughter and himself:And, for the good report I hear of youAnd for the love he beareth to your daughterAnd she to him, to stay him not too long,I am content, in a good father's care,To have him match'd; and if you please to likeNo worse than I, upon some agreementMe shall you find ready and willingWith one consent to have her so bestow'd;For curious I cannot be with you,Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:Your plainness and your shortness please me well.Right true it is, your son Lucentio hereDoth love my daughter and she loveth him,Or both dissemble deeply their affections:And therefore, if you say no more than this,That like a father you will deal with himAnd pass my daughter a sufficient dower,The match is made, and all is done:Your son shall have my daughter with consent.I thank you, sir. Where then do you know bestWe be affied and such assurance ta'enAs shall with either part's agreement stand?Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;And happily we might be interrupted.Then at my lodging, an it like you:There doth my father lie; and there, this night,We'll pass the business privately and well.Send for your daughter by your servant here:My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,And bid Bianca make her ready straight;And, if you will, tell what hath happened,Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.I pray the gods she may with all my heart!Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.I follow you.Cambio!What sayest thou, Biondello?You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?Biondello, what of that?Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, toexpound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.I pray thee, moralize them.Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with thedeceiving father of a deceitful son.And what of him?His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.And then?The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at yourcommand at all hours.And what of all this?I cannot tell; expect they are busied about acounterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to thechurch; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficienthonest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell forever and a day.Hearest thou, Biondello?I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in anafternoon as she went to the garden for parsley tostuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,sir. My master hath appointed me to go to SaintLuke's, to bid the priest be ready to come againstyou come with your appendix.I may, and will, if she be so contented:She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.
