Verona, for a while I take my leave,To see my friends in Padua, but of allMy best beloved and approved friend,Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man hasrebused your worship?Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, thatI should knock you here, sir?Villain, I say, knock me at this gateAnd rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knockyou first,And then I know after who comes by the worst.Will it not be?Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.Help, masters, help! my master is mad.Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signormio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compoundthis quarrel.Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.if this be not a lawful case for me to leave hisservice, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and raphim soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant touse his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I hadwell knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,I bade the rascal knock upon your gateAnd could not get him for my heart to do it.Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not thesewords plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come younow with, 'knocking at the gate'?Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy galeBlows you to Padua here from old Verona?Such wind as scatters young men through the world,To seek their fortunes farther than at homeWhere small experience grows. But in a few,Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:Antonio, my father, is deceased;And I have thrust myself into this maze,Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,And so am come abroad to see the world.Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to theeAnd wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:And yet I'll promise thee she shall be richAnd very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,And I'll not wish thee to her.Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as weFew words suffice; and therefore, if thou knowOne rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewdAs Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,She moves me not, or not removes, at least,Affection's edge in me, were she as roughAs are the swelling Adriatic seas:I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;If wealthily, then happily in Padua.Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what hismind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him toa puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'era tooth in her head, though she have as many diseasesas two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,so money comes withal.Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,I will continue that I broach'd in jest.I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wifeWith wealth enough and young and beauteous,Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:Her only fault, and that is faults enough,Is that she is intolerable curstAnd shrewd and froward, so beyond all measureThat, were my state far worser than it is,I would not wed her for a mine of gold.Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;For I will board her, though she chide as loudAs thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.Her father is Baptista Minola,An affable and courteous gentleman:Her name is Katharina Minola,Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.I know her father, though I know not her;And he knew my deceased father well.I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;And therefore let me be thus bold with youTo give you over at this first encounter,Unless you will accompany me thither.I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, shewould think scolding would do little good upon him:she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail inhis rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an shestand him but a little, he will throw a figure inher face and so disfigure her with it that sheshall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.You know him not, sir.Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:He hath the jewel of my life in hold,His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,And her withholds from me and other more,Suitors to her and rivals in my love,Supposing it a thing impossible,For those defects I have before rehearsed,That ever Katharina will be woo'd;Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,That none shall have access unto BiancaTill Katharina the curst have got a husband.Katharina the curst!A title for a maid of all titles the worst.Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,And offer me disguised in sober robesTo old Baptista as a schoolmasterWell seen in music, to instruct Bianca;That so I may, by this device, at leastHave leave and leisure to make love to herAnd unsuspected court her by herself.Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,how the young folks lay their heads together!Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.Petruchio, stand by a while.A proper stripling and an amorous!O, very well; I have perused the note.Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:All books of love, see that at any hand;And see you read no other lectures to her:You understand me: over and besideSignior Baptista's liberality,I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,And let me have them very well perfumedFor she is sweeter than perfume itselfTo whom they go to. What will you read to her?Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for youAs for my patron, stand you so assured,As firmly as yourself were still in place:Yea, and perhaps with more successful wordsThan you, unless you were a scholar, sir.O this learning, what a thing it is!O this woodcock, what an ass it is!Peace, sirrah!Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.I promised to inquire carefullyAbout a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:And by good fortune I have lighted wellOn this young man, for learning and behaviorFit for her turn, well read in poetryAnd other books, good ones, I warrant ye.'Tis well; and I have met a gentlemanHath promised me to help me to another,A fine musician to instruct our mistress;So shall I no whit be behind in dutyTo fair Bianca, so beloved of me.Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.And that his bags shall prove.Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,Upon agreement from us to his liking,Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.So said, so done, is well.Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?I know she is an irksome brawling scold:If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:My father dead, my fortune lives for me;And I do hope good days and long to see.O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:You shall have me assisting you in all.But will you woo this wild-cat?Will I live?Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.Why came I hither but to that intent?Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?Have I not in my time heard lions roar?Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with windsRage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?Have I not in a pitched battle heardLoud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,That gives not half so great a blow to hearAs will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.For he fears none.Hortensio, hark:This gentleman is happily arrived,My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.I promised we would be contributorsAnd bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.And so we will, provided that he win her.I would I were as sure of a good dinner.Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest wayTo the house of Signior Baptista Minola?He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?Even he, Biondello.Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.Well begun, Tranio.Sir, a word ere you go;Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?And if I be, sir, is it any offence?No; if without more words you will get you hence.Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as freeFor me as for you?But so is not she.For what reason, I beseech you?For this reason, if you'll know,That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,Do me this right; hear me with patience.Baptista is a noble gentleman,To whom my father is not all unknown;And were his daughter fairer than she is,She may more suitors have and me for one.Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;Then well one more may fair Bianca have:And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.Hortensio, to what end are all these words?Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,The one as famous for a scolding tongueAs is the other for beauteous modesty.Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:The younges t daughter whom you hearken forHer father keeps from all access of suitors,And will not promise her to any manUntil the elder sister first be wed:The younger then is free and not before.If it be so, sir, that you are the manMust stead us all and me amongst the rest,And if you break the ice and do this feat,Achieve the elder, set the younger freeFor our access, whose hap shall be to have herWill not so graceless be to be ingrate.Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;And since you do profess to be a suitor,You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,To whom we all rest generally beholding.Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,And do as adversaries do in law,Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.The motion's good indeed and be it so,Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.
