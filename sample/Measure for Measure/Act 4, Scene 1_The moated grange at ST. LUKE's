Take, O, take those lips away,That so sweetly were forsworn;And those eyes, the break of day,Lights that do mislead the morn:But my kisses bring again, bring again;Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:Here comes a man of comfort, whose adviceHath often still'd my brawling discontent.I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wishYou had not found me here so musical:Let me excuse me, and believe me so,My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charmTo make bad good, and good provoke to harm.I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquiredfor me here to-day? much upon this time haveI promised here to meet.You have not been inquired after:I have sat here all day.I do constantly believe you. The time is come evennow. I shall crave your forbearance a little: maybe I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.I am always bound to you.Very well met, and well come.What is the news from this good deputy?He hath a garden circummured with brick,Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;And to that vineyard is a planched gate,That makes his opening with this bigger key:This other doth command a little doorWhich from the vineyard to the garden leads;There have I made my promiseUpon the heavy middle of the nightTo call upon him.But shall you on your knowledge find this way?I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:With whispering and most guilty diligence,In action all of precept, he did show meThe way twice o'er.Are there no other tokensBetween you 'greed concerning her observance?No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;And that I have possess'd him my most stayCan be but brief; for I have made him knowI have a servant comes with me along,That stays upon me, whose persuasion isI come about my brother.'Tis well borne up.I have not yet made known to MarianaA word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;She comes to do you good.I do desire the like.Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.Take, then, this your companion by the hand,Who hath a story ready for your ear.I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;The vaporous night approaches.Will't please you walk aside?O place and greatness! millions of false eyesAre stuck upon thee: volumes of reportRun with these false and most contrarious questsUpon thy doings: thousand escapes of witMake thee the father of their idle dreamsAnd rack thee in their fancies.Welcome, how agreed?She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,If you advise it.It is not my consent,But my entreaty too.Little have you to sayWhen you depart from him, but, soft and low,'Remember now my brother.'Fear me not.Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.He is your husband on a pre-contract:To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,Sith that the justice of your title to himDoth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.
