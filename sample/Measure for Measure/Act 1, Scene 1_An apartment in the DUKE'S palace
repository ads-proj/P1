Escalus.My lord.Of government the properties to unfold,Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;Since I am put to know that your own scienceExceeds, in that, the lists of all adviceMy strength can give you: then no more remains,But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,And let them work. The nature of our people,Our city's institutions, and the termsFor common justice, you're as pregnant inAs art and practise hath enriched anyThat we remember. There is our commission,From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,I say, bid come before us Angelo.What figure of us think you he will bear?For you must know, we have with special soulElected him our absence to supply,Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,And given his deputation all the organsOf our own power: what think you of it?If any in Vienna be of worthTo undergo such ample grace and honour,It is Lord Angelo.Look where he comes.Always obedient to your grace's will,I come to know your pleasure.Angelo,There is a kind of character in thy life,That to the observer doth thy historyFully unfold. Thyself and thy belongingsAre not thine own so proper as to wasteThyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,Not light them for themselves; for if our virtuesDid not go forth of us, 'twere all alikeAs if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'dBut to fine issues, nor Nature never lendsThe smallest scruple of her excellenceBut, like a thrifty goddess, she determinesHerself the glory of a creditor,Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speechTo one that can my part in him advertise;Hold therefore, Angelo:--In our remove be thou at full ourself;Mortality and mercy in ViennaLive in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,Though first in question, is thy secondary.Take thy commission.Now, good my lord,Let there be some more test made of my metal,Before so noble and so great a figureBe stamp'd upon it.No more evasion:We have with a leaven'd and prepared choiceProceeded to you; therefore take your honours.Our haste from hence is of so quick conditionThat it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'dMatters of needful value. We shall write to you,As time and our concernings shall importune,How it goes with us, and do look to knowWhat doth befall you here. So, fare you well;To the hopeful execution do I leave youOf your commissions.Yet give leave, my lord,That we may bring you something on the way.My haste may not admit it;Nor need you, on mine honour, have to doWith any scruple; your scope is as mine ownSo to enforce or qualify the lawsAs to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:I'll privily away. I love the people,But do not like to stage me to their eyes:Through it do well, I do not relish wellTheir loud applause and Aves vehement;Nor do I think the man of safe discretionThat does affect it. Once more, fare you well.The heavens give safety to your purposes!Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!I thank you. Fare you well.I shall desire you, sir, to give me leaveTo have free speech with you; and it concerns meTo look into the bottom of my place:A power I have, but of what strength and natureI am not yet instructed.'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,And we may soon our satisfaction haveTouching that point.I'll wait upon your honour.
