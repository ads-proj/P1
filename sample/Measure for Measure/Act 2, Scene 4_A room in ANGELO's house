When I would pray and think, I think and prayTo several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,As if I did but only chew his name;And in my heart the strong and swelling evilOf my conception. The state, whereon I studiedIs like a good thing, being often read,Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,Could I with boot change for an idle plume,Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser soulsTo thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:'Tis not the devil's crest.How now! who's there?One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.Teach her the way.O heavens!Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,Making both it unable for itself,And dispossessing all my other partsOf necessary fitness?So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;Come all to help him, and so stop the airBy which he should revive: and even soThe general, subject to a well-wish'd king,Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondnessCrowd to his presence, where their untaught loveMust needs appear offence.How now, fair maid?I am come to know your pleasure.That you might know it, would much better please meThan to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.Even so. Heaven keep your honour!Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,yet he must die.Under your sentence?Yea.When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,Longer or shorter, he may be so fittedThat his soul sicken not.Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as goodTo pardon him that hath from nature stolenA man already made, as to remitTheir saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's imageIn stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easyFalsely to take away a life true madeAs to put metal in restrained meansTo make a false one.'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.Which had you rather, that the most just lawNow took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,Give up your body to such sweet uncleannessAs she that he hath stain'd?Sir, believe this,I had rather give my body than my soul.I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sinsStand more for number than for accompt.How say you?Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speakAgainst the thing I say. Answer to this:I, now the voice of the recorded law,Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:Might there not be a charity in sinTo save this brother's life?Please you to do't,I'll take it as a peril to my soul,It is no sin at all, but charity.Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,Were equal poise of sin and charity.That I do beg his life, if it be sin,Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayerTo have it added to the faults of mine,And nothing of your answer.Nay, but hear me.Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,But graciously to know I am no better.Thus wisdom wishes to appear most brightWhen it doth tax itself; as these black masksProclaim an enshield beauty ten times louderThan beauty could, display'd. But mark me;To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:Your brother is to die.So.And his offence is so, as it appears,Accountant to the law upon that pain.True.Admit no other way to save his life,--As I subscribe not that, nor any other,But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,Finding yourself desired of such a person,Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,Could fetch your brother from the manaclesOf the all-building law; and that there wereNo earthly mean to save him, but that eitherYou must lay down the treasures of your bodyTo this supposed, or else to let him suffer;What would you do?As much for my poor brother as myself:That is, were I under the terms of death,The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,And strip myself to death, as to a bedThat longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yieldMy body up to shame.Then must your brother die.And 'twere the cheaper way:Better it were a brother died at once,Than that a sister, by redeeming him,Should die for ever.Were not you then as cruel as the sentenceThat you have slander'd so?Ignomy in ransom and free pardonAre of two houses: lawful mercyIs nothing kin to foul redemption.You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;And rather proved the sliding of your brotherA merriment than a vice.O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:I something do excuse the thing I hate,For his advantage that I dearly love.We are all frail.Else let my brother die,If not a feodary, but only heOwe and succeed thy weakness.Nay, women are frail too.Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;Which are as easy broke as they make forms.Women! Help Heaven! men their creation marIn profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;For we are soft as our complexions are,And credulous to false prints.I think it well:And from this testimony of your own sex,--Since I suppose we are made to be no strongerThan faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;I do arrest your words. Be that you are,That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;If you be one, as you are well express'dBy all external warrants, show it now,By putting on the destined livery.I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,Let me entreat you speak the former language.Plainly conceive, I love you.My brother did love Juliet,And you tell me that he shall die for it.He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.I know your virtue hath a licence in't,Which seems a little fouler than it is,To pluck on others.Believe me, on mine honour,My words express my purpose.Ha! little honour to be much believed,And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:Sign me a present pardon for my brother,Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloudWhat man thou art.Who will believe thee, Isabel?My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,Will so your accusation overweigh,That you shall stifle in your own reportAnd smell of calumny. I have begun,And now I give my sensual race the rein:Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brotherBy yielding up thy body to my will;Or else he must not only die the death,But thy unkindness shall his death draw outTo lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,Or, by the affection that now guides me most,I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,Either of condemnation or approof;Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.That, had he twenty heads to tender downOn twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,Before his sister should her body stoopTo such abhorr'd pollution.Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:More than our brother is our chastity.I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.
