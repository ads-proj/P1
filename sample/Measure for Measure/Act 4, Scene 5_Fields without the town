These letters at fit time deliver meThe provost knows our purpose and our plot.The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,And hold you ever to our special drift;Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,And tell him where I stay: give the like noticeTo Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;But send me Flavius first.It shall be speeded well.I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:Come, we will walk. There's other of our friendsWill greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.
