I am as well acquainted here as I was in our houseof profession: one would think it were MistressOverdone's own house, for here be many of her oldcustomers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's infor a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he madefive marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was notmuch in request, for the old women were all dead.Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit ofMaster Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits ofpeach-coloured satin, which now peaches him abeggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and youngMaster Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and MasterStarve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and youngDrop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and MasterForthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty thegreat traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbedPots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers inour trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.Master Barnardine!What, ho, Barnardine![Within]  A pox o' your throats! Who makes thatnoise there? What are you?Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be sogood, sir, to rise and be put to death.[Within]  Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you areexecuted, and sleep afterwards.Go in to him, and fetch him out.He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?Very ready, sir.How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into yourprayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am notfitted for 't.O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep thesounder all the next day.Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: dowe jest now, think you?Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastilyyou are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfortyou and pray with you.Friar, not I	I have been drinking hard all night,and I will have more time to prepare me, or theyshall beat out my brains with billets: I will notconsent to die this day, that's certain.O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech youLook forward on the journey you shall go.I swear I will not die to-day for any man'spersuasion.But hear you.Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!After him, fellows; bring him to the block.Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;And to transport him in the mind he isWere damnable.Here in the prison, father,There died this morning of a cruel feverOne Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,A man of Claudio's years; his beard and headJust of his colour. What if we do omitThis reprobate till he were well inclined;And satisfy the deputy with the visageOf Ragozine, more like to Claudio?O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!Dispatch it presently; the hour draws onPrefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,And sent according to command; whiles IPersuade this rude wretch willingly to die.This shall be done, good father, presently.But Barnardine must die this afternoon:And how shall we continue Claudio,To save me from the danger that might comeIf he were known alive?Let this be done.Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greetingTo the under generation, you shall findYour safety manifested.I am your free dependant.Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.Now will I write letters to Angelo,--The provost, he shall bear them, whose contentsShall witness to him I am near at home,And that, by great injunctions, I am boundTo enter publicly: him I'll desireTo meet me at the consecrated fountA league below the city; and from thence,By cold gradation and well-balanced form,We shall proceed with Angelo.Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.Convenient is it. Make a swift return;For I would commune with you of such thingsThat want no ear but yours.I'll make all speed.[Within]  Peace, ho, be here!The tongue of Isabel. She's come to knowIf yet her brother's pardon be come hither:But I will keep her ignorant of her good,To make her heavenly comforts of despair,When it is least expected.Ho, by your leave!Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.The better, given me by so holy a man.Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:His head is off and sent to Angelo.Nay, but it is not so.It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,In your close patience.O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!You shall not be admitted to his sight.Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!Injurious world! most damned Angelo!This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.Mark what I say, which you shall findBy every syllable a faithful verity:The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;One of our convent, and his confessor,Gives me this instance: already he hath carriedNotice to Escalus and Angelo,Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdomIn that good path that I would wish it go,And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,And general honour.I am directed by you.This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:Say, by this token, I desire his companyAt Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yoursI'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring youBefore the duke, and to the head of AngeloAccuse him home and home. For my poor self,I am combined by a sacred vowAnd shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:Command these fretting waters from your eyesWith a light heart; trust not my holy order,If I pervert your course. Who's here?Good even. Friar, where's the provost?Not within, sir.O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to seethine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fainto dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not formy head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would setme to 't. But they say the duke will be hereto-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had beenat home, he had lived.Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to yourreports; but the best is, he lives not in them.Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.Nay, tarry; I'll go along with theeI can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.You have told me too many of him already, sir, ifthey be true; if not true, none were enough.I was once before him for getting a wench with child.Did you such a thing?Yes, marry, did I	but I was fain to forswear it;they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little ofit. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.
