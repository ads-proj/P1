So that by this intelligence we learnThe Welshmen are dispersed, and SalisburyIs gone to meet the king, who lately landedWith some few private friends upon this coast.The news is very fair and good, my lord:Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.It would beseem the Lord NorthumberlandTo say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy dayWhen such a sacred king should hide his head.Your grace mistakes; only to be briefLeft I his title out.The time hath been,Would you have been so brief with him, he wouldHave been so brief with you, to shorten you,For taking so the head, your whole head's length.Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.Take not, good cousin, further than you should.Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.I know it, uncle, and oppose not myselfAgainst their will. But who comes here?Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,Against thy entrance.Royally!Why, it contains no king?Yes, my good lord,It doth contain a king; King Richard liesWithin the limits of yon lime and stone:And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergymanOf holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.Noble lords,Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parleyInto his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:Henry BolingbrokeOn both his knees doth kiss King Richard's handAnd sends allegiance and true faith of heartTo his most royal person, hither comeEven at his feet to lay my arms and power,Provided that my banishment repeal'dAnd lands restored again be freely granted:If not, I'll use the advantage of my powerAnd lay the summer's dust with showers of bloodRain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:The which, how far off from the mind of BolingbrokeIt is, such crimson tempest should bedrenchThe fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,My stooping duty tenderly shall show.Go, signify as much, while here we marchUpon the grassy carpet of this plain.Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,That from this castle's tatter'd battlementsOur fair appointments may be well perused.Methinks King Richard and myself should meetWith no less terror than the elementsOf fire and water, when their thundering shockAt meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rainMy waters; on the earth, and not on him.March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,As doth the blushing discontented sunFrom out the fiery portal of the east,When he perceives the envious clouds are bentTo dim his glory and to stain the trackOf his bright passage to the occident.Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forthControlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,That any harm should stain so fair a show!We are amazed; and thus long have we stoodTo watch the fearful bending of thy knee,Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:And if we be, how dare thy joints forgetTo pay their awful duty to our presence?If we be not, show us the hand of GodThat hath dismissed us from our stewardship;For well we know, no hand of blood and boneCan gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.And though you think that all, as you have done,Have torn their souls by turning them from us,And we are barren and bereft of friends;Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,Is mustering in his clouds on our behalfArmies of pestilence; and they shall strikeYour children yet unborn and unbegot,That lift your vassal hands against my headAnd threat the glory of my precious crown.Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--That every stride he makes upon my landIs dangerous treason: he is come to openThe purple testament of bleeding war;But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sonsShall ill become the flower of England's face,Change the complexion of her maid-pale peaceTo scarlet indignation and bedewHer pastures' grass with faithful English blood.The king of heaven forbid our lord the kingShould so with civil and uncivil armsBe rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousinHarry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;And by the honourable tomb he swears,That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,And by the royalties of both your bloods,Currents that spring from one most gracious head,And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,And by the worth and honour of himself,Comprising all that may be sworn or said,His coming hither hath no further scopeThan for his lineal royalties and to begEnfranchisement immediate on his kn ees:Which on thy royal party granted once,His glittering arms he will commend to rust,His barbed steeds to stables, and his heartTo faithful service of your majesty.This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.Northumberland, say thus the king returns:His noble cousin is right welcome hither;And all the number of his fair demandsShall be accomplish'd without contradiction:With all the gracious utterance thou hastSpeak to his gentle hearing kind commends.We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,To look so poorly and to speak so fair?Shall we call back Northumberland, and sendDefiance to the traitor, and so die?No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle wordsTill time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,That laid the sentence of dread banishmentOn yon proud man, should take it off againWith words of sooth! O that I were as greatAs is my grief, or lesser than my name!Or that I could forget what I have been,Or not remember what I must be now!Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.What must the king do now? must he submit?The king shall do it: must he be deposed?The king shall be contented: must he loseThe name of king? o' God's name, let it go:I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,My figured goblets for a dish of wood,My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,My subjects for a pair of carved saintsAnd my large kingdom for a little grave,A little little grave, an obscure grave;Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,Some way of common trade, where subjects' feetMay hourly trample on their sovereign's head;For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;And buried once, why not upon my head?Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!We'll make foul weather with despised tears;Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,And make a dearth in this revolting land.Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,And make some pretty match with shedding tears?As thus, to drop them still upon one place,Till they have fretted us a pair of gravesWithin the earth; and, therein laid,--there liesTwo kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I seeI talk but idly, and you laugh at me.Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,What says King Bolingbroke? will his majestyGive Richard leave to live till Richard die?You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.My lord, in the base court he doth attendTo speak with you; may it please you to come down.Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,Wanting the manage of unruly jades.In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.In the base court? Come down? Down, court!down, king!For night-owls shriek where mounting larksshould sing.What says his majesty?Sorrow and grief of heartMakes him speak fondly, like a frantic manYet he is come.Stand all apart,And show fair duty to his majesty.My gracious lord,--Fair cousin, you debase your princely kneeTo make the base earth proud with kissing it:Me rather had my heart might feel your loveThan my unpleased eye see your courtesy.Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,Thus high at least, although your knee be low.My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,As my true service shall deserve your love.Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,That know the strong'st and surest way to get.Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;Tears show their love, but want their remedies.Cousin, I am too young to be your father,Though you are old enough to be my heir.What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;For do we must what force will have us do.Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?Yea, my good lord.Then I must not say no.
