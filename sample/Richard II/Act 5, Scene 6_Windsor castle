Kind uncle York, the latest news we hearIs that the rebels have consumed with fireOur town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.Welcome, my lord	what is the news?First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.The next news is, I have to London sentThe heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:The manner of their taking may appearAt large discoursed in this paper here.We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.My lord, I have from Oxford sent to LondonThe heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,Two of the dangerous consorted traitorsThat sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,With clog of conscience and sour melancholyHath yielded up his body to the grave;But here is Carlisle living, to abideThy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.Carlisle, this is your doom:Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.Great king, within this coffin I presentThy buried fear: herein all breathless liesThe mightiest of thy greatest enemies,Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wroughtA deed of slander with thy fatal handUpon my head and all this famous land.From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.They love not poison that do poison need,Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,I hate the murderer, love him murdered.The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,But neither my good word nor princely favour:With Cain go wander through shades of night,And never show thy head by day nor light.Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,And put on sullen black incontinent:I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:March sadly after; grace my mournings here;In weeping after this untimely bier.
