Madam, your majesty is too much sad:You promised, when you parted with the king,To lay aside life-harming heavinessAnd entertain a cheerful disposition.To please the king I did; to please myselfI cannot do it; yet I know no causeWhy I should welcome such a guest as grief,Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guestAs my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,Is coming towards me, and my inward soulWith nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,More than with parting from my lord the king.Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,Divides one thing entire to many objects;Like perspectives, which rightly gazed uponShow nothing but confusion, eyed awryDistinguish form: so your sweet majesty,Looking awry upon your lord's departure,Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadowsOf what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,Which for things true weeps things imaginary.It may be so; but yet my inward soulPersuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,I cannot but be sad; so heavy sadAs, though on thinking on no thought I think,Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derivedFrom some forefather grief; mine is not so,For nothing had begot my something grief;Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:'Tis in reversion that I do possess;But what it is, that is not yet known; whatI cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?That he, our hope, might have retired his power,And driven into despair an enemy's hope,Who strongly hath set footing in this land:The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,And with uplifted arms is safe arrivedAt Ravenspurgh.Now God in heaven forbid!Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.Why have you not proclaim'd NorthumberlandAnd all the rest revolted faction traitors?We have: whereupon the Earl of WorcesterHath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,And all the household servants fled with himTo Bolingbroke.So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.Despair not, madam.Who shall hinder me?I will despair, and be at enmityWith cozening hope: he is a flatterer,A parasite, a keeper back of death,Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,Which false hope lingers in extremity.Here comes the Duke of York.With signs of war about his aged neck:O, full of careful business are his looks!Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.Your husband, he is gone to save far off,Whilst others come to make him lose at home:Here am I left to underprop his land,Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.My lord, your son was gone before I came.He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:Hold, take my ring.My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,To-day, as I came by, I called there;But I shall grieve you to report the rest.What is't, knave?An hour before I came, the duchess died.God for his mercy! what a tide of woesComes rushing on this woeful land at once!I know not what to do: I would to God,So my untruth had not provoked him to it,The king had cut off my head with my brother's.What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?How shall we do for money for these wars?Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some cartsAnd bring away the armour that is there.Gentlemen, will you go muster men?If I know how or which way to order these affairsThus thrust disorderly into my hands,Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:The one is my sovereign, whom both my oathAnd duty bids defend; the other againIs my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'llDispose of you.Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,And meet me presently at Berkeley.I should to Plashy too;But time will not permit: all is uneven,And every thing is left at six and seven.The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,But none returns. For us to levy powerProportionable to the enemyIs all unpossible.Besides, our nearness to the king in loveIs near the hate of those love not the king.And that's the wavering commons: for their loveLies in their purses, and whoso empties themBy so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.If judgement lie in them, then so do we,Because we ever have been near the king.Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.Thither will I with you; for little officeThe hateful commons will perform for us,Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.Will you go along with us?No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakesIs numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.Well, we may meet again.I fear me, never.
