What country, friends, is this?This is Illyria, lady.And what should I do in Illyria?My brother he is in Elysium.Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?It is perchance that you yourself were saved.O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,Assure yourself, after our ship did split,When you and those poor number saved with youHung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,Most provident in peril, bind himself,Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,I saw him hold acquaintance with the wavesSo long as I could see.For saying so, there's gold:Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,Whereto thy speech serves for authority,The like of him. Know'st thou this country?Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and bornNot three hours' travel from this very place.Who governs here?A noble duke, in nature as in name.What is the name?Orsino.Orsino! I have heard my father name him:He was a bachelor then.And so is now, or was so very late;For but a month ago I went from hence,And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,What great ones do the less will prattle of,--That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.What's she?A virtuous maid, the daughter of a countThat died some twelvemonth since, then leaving herIn the protection of his son, her brother,Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,They say, she hath abjured the companyAnd sight of men.O that I served that ladyAnd might not be delivered to the world,Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,What my estate is!That were hard to compass;Because she will admit no kind of suit,No, not the duke's.There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;And though that nature with a beauteous wallDoth oft close in pollution, yet of theeI will believe thou hast a mind that suitsWith this thy fair and outward character.I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,Conceal me what I am, and be my aidFor such disguise as haply shall becomeThe form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:It may be worth thy pains; for I can singAnd speak to him in many sorts of musicThat will allow me very worth his service.What else may hap to time I will commit;Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.I thank thee: lead me on.
