This is the air; that is the glorious sun;This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?I could not find him at the Elephant:Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,That he did range the town to seek me out.His counsel now might do me golden service;For though my soul disputes well with my sense,That this may be some error, but no madness,Yet doth this accident and flood of fortuneSo far exceed all instance, all discourse,That I am ready to distrust mine eyesAnd wrangle with my reason that persuades meTo any other trust but that I am madOr else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,She could not sway her house, command her followers,Take and give back affairs and their dispatchWith such a smooth, discreet and stable bearingAs I perceive she does: there's something in'tThat is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,Now go with me and with this holy manInto the chantry by: there, before him,And underneath that consecrated roof,Plight me the full assurance of your faith;That my most jealous and too doubtful soulMay live at peace. He shall conceal itWhiles you are willing it shall come to note,What time we will our celebration keepAccording to my birth. What do you say?I'll follow this good man, and go with you;And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,That they may fairly note this act of mine!
