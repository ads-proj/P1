If the duke continue these favours towards you,Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hathknown you but three days, and already you are no stranger.You either fear his humour or my negligence, thatyou call in question the continuance of his love:is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?No, believe me.I thank you. Here comes the count.Who saw Cesario, ho?On your attendance, my lord; here.Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'dTo thee the book even of my secret soul:Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;Be not denied access, stand at her doors,And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall growTill thou have audience.Sure, my noble lord,If she be so abandon'd to her sorrowAs it is spoke, she never will admit me.Be clamorous and leap all civil boundsRather than make unprofited return.Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?O, then unfold the passion of my love,Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:It shall become thee well to act my woes;She will attend it better in thy youthThan in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.I think not so, my lord.Dear lad, believe it;For they shall yet belie thy happy years,That say thou art a man: Diana's lipIs not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipeIs as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,And all is semblative a woman's part.I know thy constellation is right aptFor this affair. Some four or five attend him;All, if you will; for I myself am bestWhen least in company. Prosper well in this,And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,To call his fortunes thine.I'll do my bestTo woo your lady:yet, a barful strife!Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.
