Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly overme: the malignancy of my fate might perhapsdistemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you yourleave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a badrecompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mereextravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent atouch of modesty, that you will not extort from mewhat I am willing to keep in; therefore it chargesme in manners the rather to express myself. Youmust know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,which I called Roderigo. My father was thatSebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heardof. He left behind him myself and a sister, bothborn in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;for some hour before you took me from the breach ofthe sea was my sister drowned.Alas the day!A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembledme, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,though I could not with such estimable wonderoverfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldlypublish her; she bore a mind that envy could not butcall fair. She is drowned already, sir, with saltwater, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.If you will not murder me for my love, let me beyour servant.If you will not undo what you have done, that is,kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, thatupon the least occasion more mine eyes will telltales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!I have many enemies in Orsino's court,Else would I very shortly see thee there.But, come what may, I do adore thee so,That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
