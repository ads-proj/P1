Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?Are not you moved, when all the sway of earthShakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,I have seen tempests, when the scolding windsHave rived the knotty oaks, and I have seenThe ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,To be exalted with the threatening clouds:But never till to-night, never till now,Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.Either there is a civil strife in heaven,Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,Incenses them to send destruction.Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?A common slave--you know him well by sight--Held up his left hand, which did flame and burnLike twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--Against the Capitol I met a lion,Who glared upon me, and went surly by,Without annoying me: and there were drawnUpon a heap a hundred ghastly women,Transformed with their fear; who swore they sawMen all in fire walk up and down the streets.And yesterday the bird of night did sitEven at noon-day upon the market-place,Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigiesDo so conjointly meet, let not men say'These are their reasons; they are natural;'For, I believe, they are portentous thingsUnto the climate that they point upon.Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:But men may construe things after their fashion,Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?He doth; for he did bid AntoniusSend word to you he would be there to-morrow.Good night then, Casca: this disturbed skyIs not to walk in.Farewell, Cicero.Who's there?A Roman.Casca, by your voice.Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!A very pleasing night to honest men.Who ever knew the heavens menace so?Those that have known the earth so full of faults.For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,Submitting me unto the perilous night,And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to openThe breast of heaven, I did present myselfEven in the aim and very flash of it.But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?It is the part of men to fear and tremble,When the most mighty gods by tokens sendSuch dreadful heralds to astonish us.You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of lifeThat should be in a Roman you do want,Or else you use not. You look pale and gazeAnd put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,To see the strange impatience of the heavens:But if you would consider the true causeWhy all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,Why old men fool and children calculate,Why all these things change from their ordinanceTheir natures and preformed facultiesTo monstrous quality,--why, you shall findThat heaven hath infused them with these spirits,To make them instruments of fear and warningUnto some monstrous state.Now could I, Casca, name to thee a manMost like this dreadful night,That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roarsAs doth the lion in the Capitol,A man no mightier than thyself or meIn personal action, yet prodigious grownAnd fearful, as these strange eruptions are.'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?Let it be who it is: for Romans nowHave thews and limbs like to their ancestors;But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.Indeed, they say the senators tomorrowMean to establish Caesar as a king;And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,In every place, save here in Italy.I know where I will wear this dagger then;Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;But life, being weary of these worldly bars,Never lacks power to dismiss itself.If I know this, know all the world besides,That part of tyranny that I do bearI can shake off at pleasure.So can I:So every bondman in his own hand bearsThe power to cancel his captivity.And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.Those that with haste will make a mighty fireBegin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,What rubbish and what offal, when it servesFor the base matter to illuminateSo vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak thisBefore a willing bondman; then I knowMy answer must be made. But I am arm'd,And dangers are to me indifferent.You speak to Casca, and to such a manThat is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:Be factious for redress of all these griefs,And I will set this foot of mine as farAs who goes farthest.There's a bargain made.Now know you, Casca, I have moved alreadySome certain of the noblest-minded RomansTo undergo with me an enterpriseOf honourable-dangerous consequence;And I do know, by this, they stay for meIn Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,There is no stir or walking in the streets;And the complexion of the elementIn favour's like the work we have in hand,Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;He is a friend.Cinna, where haste you so?To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?No, it is Casca; one incorporateTo our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.Am I not stay'd for? tell me.Yes, you are.O Cassius, if you couldBut win the noble Brutus to our party--Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,Where Brutus may but find it; and throw thisIn at his window; set this up with waxUpon old Brutus' statue: all this done,Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?All but Metellus Cimber; and he's goneTo seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,And so bestow these papers as you bade me.That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere daySee Brutus at his house: three parts of himIs ours already, and the man entireUpon the next encounter yields him ours.O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:And that which would appear offence in us,His countenance, like richest alchemy,Will change to virtue and to worthiness.Him and his worth and our great need of himYou have right well conceited. Let us go,For it is after midnight; and ere dayWe will awake him and be sure of him.
