[To the Soothsayer]  The ides of March are come.Ay, Caesar; but not gone.Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,At your best leisure, this his humble suit.O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suitThat touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.What touches us ourself shall be last served.Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.What, is the fellow mad?Sirrah, give place.What, urge you your petitions in the street?Come to the Capitol.I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.What enterprise, Popilius?Fare you well.What said Popilius Lena?He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.I fear our purpose is discovered.Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,For I will slay myself.Cassius, be constant:Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.He draws Mark Antony out of the way.Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.He is address'd: press near and second him.Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.Are we all ready? What is now amissThat Caesar and his senate must redress?Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,Metellus Cimber throws before thy seatAn humble heart,--I must prevent thee, Cimber.These couchings and these lowly courtesiesMight fire the blood of ordinary men,And turn pre-ordinance and first decreeInto the law of children. Be not fond,To think that Caesar bears such rebel bloodThat will be thaw'd from the true qualityWith that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.Thy brother by decree is banished:If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without causeWill he be satisfied.Is there no voice more worthy than my ownTo sound more sweetly in great Caesar's earFor the repealing of my banish'd brother?I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;Desiring thee that Publius Cimber mayHave an immediate freedom of repeal.What, Brutus!Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.I could be well moved, if I were as you:If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:But I am constant as the northern star,Of whose true-fix'd and resting qualityThere is no fellow in the firmament.The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,They are all fire and every one doth shine,But there's but one in all doth hold his place:So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;Yet in the number I do know but oneThat unassailable holds on his rank,Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,Let me a little show it, even in this;That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,And constant do remain to keep him so.O Caesar,--Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?Great Caesar,--Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?Speak, hands for me!Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.Some to the common pulpits, and cry out'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'People and senators, be not affrighted;Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.Go to the pulpit, Brutus.And Cassius too.Where's Publius?Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar'sShould chance--Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;There is no harm intended to your person,Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.Do so: and let no man abide this deed,But we the doers.Where is Antony?Fled to his house amazed:Men, wives and children stare, cry out and runAs it were doomsday.Fates, we will know your pleasures:That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the timeAnd drawing days out, that men stand upon.Why, he that cuts off twenty years of lifeCuts off so many years of fearing death.Grant that, and then is death a benefit:So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridgedHis time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's bloodUp to the elbows, and besmear our swords:Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages henceShall this our lofty scene be acted overIn states unborn and accents yet unknown!How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,That now on Pompey's basis lies alongNo worthier than the dust!So oft as that shall be,So often shall the knot of us be call'dThe men that gave their country liberty.What, shall we forth?Ay, every man away:Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heelsWith the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.If Brutus will vouchsafe that AntonyMay safely come to him, and be resolvedHow Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,Mark Antony shall not love Caesar deadSo well as Brutus living; but will followThe fortunes and affairs of noble BrutusThorough the hazards of this untrod stateWith all true faith. So says my master Antony.Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;I never thought him worse.Tell him, so please him come unto this place,He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,Depart untouch'd.I'll fetch him presently.I know that we shall have him well to friend.I wish we may: but yet have I a mindThat fears him much; and my misgiving stillFalls shrewdly to the purpose.But here comes Antony.Welcome, Mark Antony.O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:If I myself, there is no hour so fitAs Caesar's death hour, nor no instrumentOf half that worth as those your swords, made richWith the most noble blood of all this world.I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,I shall not find myself so apt to die:No place will please me so, no mean of death,As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,The choice and master spirits of this age.O Antony, beg not your death of us.Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,As, by our hands and this our present act,You see we do, yet see you but our handsAnd this the bleeding business they have done:Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;And pity to the general wrong of Rome--As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:Our arms, in strength of malice, and our heartsOf brothers' temper, do receive you inWith all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.Your voice shall be as strong as any man'sIn the disposing of new dignities.Only be patient till we have appeasedThe multitude, beside themselves with fear,And then we will deliver you the cause,Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,Have thus proceeded.I doubt not of your wisdom.Let each man render me his bloody hand:First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?My credit now stands on such slippery ground,That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,Either a coward or a flatterer.That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:If then thy spirit look upon us now,Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,It would become me better than to closeIn terms of friendship with thine enemies.Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.How like a deer, strucken by many princes,Dost thou here lie!Mark Antony,--Pardon me, Caius Cassius:The enemies of Caesar shall say this;Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.I blame you not for praising Caesar so;But what compact mean you to have with us?Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;Or shall we on, and not depend on you?Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.Friends am I with you all and love you all,Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasonsWhy and wherein Caesar was dangerous.Or else were this a savage spectacle:Our reasons are so full of good regardThat were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,You should be satisfied.That's all I seek:And am moreover suitor that I mayProduce his body to the market-place;And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,Speak in the order of his funeral.You shall, Mark Antony.Brutus, a word with you.You know not what you do: do not consentThat Antony speak in his funeral:Know you how much the people may be movedBy that which he will utter?By your pardon;I will myself into the pulpit first,And show the reason of our Caesar's death:What Antony shall speak, I will protestHe speaks by leave and by permission,And that we are contented Caesar shallHave all true rites and lawful ceremonies.It shall advantage more than do us wrong.I know not what may fall; I like it not.Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,And say you do't by our permission;Else shall you not have any hand at allAbout his funeral: and you shall speakIn the same pulpit whereto I am going,After my speech is ended.Be it so.I do desire no more.Prepare the body then, and follow us.O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!Thou art the ruins of the noblest manThat ever lived in the tide of times.Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;Domestic fury and fierce civil strifeShall cumber all the parts of Italy;Blood and destruction shall be so in useAnd dreadful objects so familiarThat mothers shall but smile when they beholdTheir infants quarter'd with the hands of war;All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,With Ate by his side come hot from hell,Shall in these confines with a monarch's voiceCry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;That this foul deed shall smell above the earthWith carrion men, groaning for burial.You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?I do, Mark Antony.Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.He did receive his letters, and is coming;And bid me say to you by word of mouth--O Caesar!--Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,Began to water. Is thy master coming?He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corseInto the market-place: there shall I tryIn my oration, how the people takeThe cruel issue of these bloody men;According to the which, thou shalt discourseTo young Octavius of the state of things.Lend me your hand.
