Have I hurt him?[Aside]  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he benot hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.[Aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o' thebackside the town.The villain would not stand me.[Aside]  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.Stand you! You have land enough of your own: buthe added to your having; gave you some ground.[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!I would they had not come between us.[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how longa fool you were upon the ground.And that she should love this fellow and refuse me![Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, sheis damned.Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her braingo not together: she's a good sign, but I have seensmall reflection of her wit.[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest thereflection should hurt her.Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been somehurt done![Aside]  I wish not so; unless it had been the fallof an ass, which is no great hurt.You'll go with us?I'll attend your lordship.Nay, come, let's go together.Well, my lord.
