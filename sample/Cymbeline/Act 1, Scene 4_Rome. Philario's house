Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he wasthen of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthyas since he hath been allowed the name of; but Icould then have looked on him without the help ofadmiration, though the catalogue of his endowmentshad been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.You speak of him when he was less furnished than nowhe is with that which makes him both without and within.I have seen him in France: we had very many therecould behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.This matter of marrying his king's daughter, whereinhe must be weighed rather by her value than his own,words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.And then his banishment.Ay, and the approbation of those that weep thislamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfullyto extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,which else an easy battery might lay flat, fortaking a beggar without less quality. But how comesit he is to sojourn with you? How creepsacquaintance?His father and I were soldiers together; to whom Ihave been often bound for no less than my life.Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertainedamongst you as suits, with gentlemen of yourknowing, to a stranger of his quality.I beseech you all, be better known to thisgentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friendof mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appearhereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.Sir, we have known together in Orleans.Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad Idid atone my countryman and you; it had been pityyou should have been put together with so mortal apurpose as then each bore, upon importance of soslight and trivial a nature.By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;rather shunned to go even with what I heard than inmy every action to be guided by others' experiences:but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to sayit is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,and by such two that would by all likelihood haveconfounded one the other, or have fallen both.Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.It was much like an argument that fell out lastnight, where each of us fell in praise of ourcountry mistresses; this gentleman at that timevouching--and upon warrant of bloodyaffirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptablethan any the rarest of our ladies in France.That lady is not now living, or this gentleman'sopinion by this worn out.She holds her virtue still and I my mind.You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.Being so far provoked as I was in France, I wouldabate her nothing, though I profess myself heradorer, not her friend.As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-handcomparison--had been something too fair and too goodfor any lady in Britain. If she went before othersI have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustresmany I have beheld. I could not but believe sheexcelled many: but I have not seen the mostprecious diamond that is, nor you the lady.I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.What do you esteem it at?More than the world enjoys.Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she'soutprized by a trifle.You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, ifthere were wealth enough for the purchase, or meritfor the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,and only the gift of the gods.Which the gods have given you?Which, by their graces, I will keep.You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Yourring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizableestimations; the one is but frail and the othercasual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplishedcourtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtierto convince the honour of my mistress, if, in theholding or loss of that, you term her frail. I donothing doubt you have store of thieves;notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.Let us leave here, gentlemen.Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, Ithank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.With five times so much conversation, I should getground of your fair mistress, make her go back, evento the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.No, no.I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate toyour ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues itsomething: but I make my wager rather against yourconfidence than her reputation: and, to bar youroffence herein too, I durst attempt it against anylady in the world.You are a great deal abused in too bold apersuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you'reworthy of by your attempt.What's that?A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,deserve more; a punishment too.Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, bebetter acquainted.Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on theapprobation of what I have spoke!What lady would you choose to assail?Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,that, commend me to the court where your lady is,with no more advantage than the opportunity of asecond conference, and I will bring from thencethat honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ringI hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buyladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannotpreserve it from tainting: but I see you have somereligion in you, that you fear.This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear agraver purpose, I hope.I am the master of my speeches, and would undergowhat's spoken, I swear.Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till yourreturn: let there be covenants drawn between's: mymistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of yourunworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.I will have it no lay.By the gods, it is one. If I bring you nosufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearestbodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducatsare yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold areyours: provided I have your commendation for my morefree entertainment.I embrace these conditions; let us have articlesbetwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: ifyou make your voyage upon her and give me directlyto understand you have prevailed, I am no furtheryour enemy; she is not worth our debate: if sheremain unseduced, you not making it appearotherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault youhave made to her chastity you shall answer me withyour sword.Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things setdown by lawful counsel, and straight away forBritain, lest the bargain should catch cold andstarve: I will fetch my gold and have our twowagers recorded.Agreed.Will this hold, think you?Signior Iachimo will not from it.Pray, let us follow 'em.
