He createsLucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,For this immediate levy, he commendsHis absolute commission. Long live Caesar!Is Lucius general of the forces?Ay.Remaining now in Gallia?With those legionsWhich I have spoke of, whereunto your levyMust be supplyant: the words of your commissionWill tie you to the numbers and the timeOf their dispatch.We will discharge our duty.
