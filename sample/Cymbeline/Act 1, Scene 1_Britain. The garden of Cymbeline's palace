You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloodsNo more obey the heavens than our courtiersStill seem as does the king.But what's the matter?His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whomHe purposed to his wife's sole son--a widowThat late he married--hath referr'd herselfUnto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: allIs outward sorrow; though I think the kingBe touch'd at very heart.None but the king?He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,That most desired the match; but not a courtier,Although they wear their faces to the bentOf the king's look's, hath a heart that is notGlad at the thing they scowl at.And why so?He that hath miss'd the princess is a thingToo bad for bad report: and he that hath her--I mean, that married her, alack, good man!And therefore banish'd--is a creature suchAs, to seek through the regions of the earthFor one his like, there would be something failingIn him that should compare. I do not thinkSo fair an outward and such stuff withinEndows a man but he.You speak him far.I do extend him, sir, within himself,Crush him together rather than unfoldHis measure duly.What's his name and birth?I cannot delve him to the root: his fatherWas call'd Sicilius, who did join his honourAgainst the Romans with Cassibelan,But had his titles by Tenantius whomHe served with glory and admired success,So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;And had, besides this gentleman in question,Two other sons, who in the wars o' the timeDied with their swords in hand; for whichtheir father,Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrowThat he quit being, and his gentle lady,Big of this gentleman our theme, deceasedAs he was born. The king he takes the babeTo his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,Puts to him all the learnings that his timeCould make him the receiver of; which he took,As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,A sample to the youngest, to the more matureA glass that feated them, and to the graverA child that guided dotards; to his mistress,For whom he now is banish'd, her own priceProclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;By her election may be truly readWhat kind of man he is.I honour himEven out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,Is she sole child to the king?His only child.He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nurseryWere stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledgeWhich way they went.How long is this ago?Some twenty years.That a king's children should be so convey'd,So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,That could not trace them!Howsoe'er 'tis strange,Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,Yet is it true, sir.I do well believe you.We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,The queen, and princess.No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,After the slander of most stepmothers,Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, butYour gaoler shall deliver you the keysThat lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,So soon as I can win the offended king,I will be known your advocate: marry, yetThe fire of rage is in him, and 'twere goodYou lean'd unto his sentence with what patienceYour wisdom may inform you.Please your highness,I will from hence to-day.You know the peril.I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pityingThe pangs of barr'd affections, though the kingHath charged you should not speak together.ODissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrantCan tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--Always reserved my holy duty--whatHis rage can do on me: you must be gone;And I shall here abide the hourly shotOf angry eyes, not comforted to live,But that there is this jewel in the worldThat I may see again.My queen! my mistress!O lady, weep no more, lest I give causeTo be suspected of more tendernessThan doth become a man. I will remainThe loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:My residence in Rome at one Philario's,Who to my father was a friend, to meKnown but by letter: thither write, my queen,And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,Though ink be made of gall.Be brief, I pray you:If the king come, I shall incur I know notHow much of his displeasure.Yet I'll move himTo walk this way: I never do him wrong,But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;Pays dear for my offences.Should we be taking leaveAs long a term as yet we have to live,The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!Nay, stay a little:Were you but riding forth to air yourself,Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;But keep it till you woo another wife,When Imogen is dead.How, how! another?You gentle gods, give me but this I have,And sear up my embracements from a nextWith bonds of death!Remain, remain thou hereWhile sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,As I my poor self did exchange for you,To your so infinite loss, so in our triflesI still win of you: for my sake wear this;It is a manacle of love; I'll place itUpon this fairest prisoner.O the gods!When shall we see again?Alack, the king!Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!If after this command thou fraught the courtWith thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!Thou'rt poison to my blood.The gods protect you!And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.There cannot be a pinch in deathMore sharp than this is.O disloyal thing,That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'stA year's age on me.I beseech you, sir,Harm not yourself with your vexationI am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rareSubdues all pangs, all fears.Past grace? obedience?Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,And did avoid a puttock.Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throneA seat for baseness.No; I rather addedA lustre to it.O thou vile one!Sir,It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:You bred him as my playfellow, and he isA man worth any woman, overbuys meAlmost the sum he pays.What, art thou mad?Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I wereA neat-herd's daughter, and my LeonatusOur neighbour shepherd's son!Thou foolish thing!They were again together: you have doneNot after our command. Away with her,And pen her up.Beseech your patience. Peace,Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfortOut of your best advice.Nay, let her languishA drop of blood a day; and, being aged,Die of this folly!Fie! you must give way.Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?My lord your son drew on my master.Ha!No harm, I trust, is done?There might have been,But that my master rather play'd than foughtAnd had no help of anger: they were partedBy gentlemen at hand.I am very glad on't.Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!I would they were in Afric both together;Myself by with a needle, that I might prickThe goer-back. Why came you from your master?On his command: he would not suffer meTo bring him to the haven; left these notesOf what commands I should be subject to,When 't pleased you to employ me.This hath beenYour faithful servant: I dare lay mine honourHe will remain so.I humbly thank your highness.Pray, walk awhile.About some half-hour hence,I pray you, speak with me: you shall at leastGo see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.
