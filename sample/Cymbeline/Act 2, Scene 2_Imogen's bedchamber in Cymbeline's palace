a trunk in one corner of it.Who's there? my woman Helen?Please you, madamWhat hour is it?Almost midnight, madam.I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:Take not away the taper, leave it burning;And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me whollyTo your protection I commend me, gods.From fairies and the tempters of the nightGuard me, beseech ye.The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd senseRepairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thusDid softly press the rushes, ere he waken'dThe chastity he wounded. Cytherea,How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing thatPerfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taperBows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,To see the enclosed lights, now canopiedUnder these windows, white and azure lacedWith blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,To note the chamber: I will write all down:Such and such pictures; there the window; suchThe adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.Ah, but some natural notes about her body,Above ten thousand meaner moveablesWould testify, to enrich mine inventory.O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!And be her sense but as a monument,Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,As strongly as the conscience does within,To the madding of her lord. On her left breastA mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson dropsI' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,Stronger than ever law could make: this secretWill force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'enThe treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?Why should I write this down, that's riveted,Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading lateThe tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd downWhere Philomel gave up. I have enough:To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawningMay bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.One, two, three: time, time!An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, themost coldest that ever turned up ace.It would make any man cold to lose.But not every man patient after the noble temper ofyour lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.Winning will put any man into courage. If I couldget this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.It's almost morning, is't not?Day, my lord.I would this music would come: I am advised to giveher music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with yourfingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if nonewill do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable richwords to it: and then let her consider.Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,And Phoebus 'gins arise,His steeds to water at those springsOn chaliced flowers that lies;And winking Mary-buds beginTo ope their golden eyes:With every thing that pretty is,My lady sweet, arise:Arise, arise.So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I willconsider your music the better: if it do not, it isa vice in her ears, which horse-hairs andcalves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch toboot, can never amend.Here comes the king.I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason Iwas up so early: he cannot choose but take thisservice I have done fatherly.Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?Will she not forth?I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.The exile of her minion is too new;She hath not yet forgot him: some more timeMust wear the print of his remembrance out,And then she's yours.You are most bound to the king,Who lets go by no vantages that mayPrefer you to his daughter. Frame yourselfTo orderly soliciting, and be friendedWith aptness of the season; make denialsIncrease your services; so seem as ifYou were inspired to do those duties whichYou tender to her; that you in all obey her,Save when command to your dismission tends,And therein you are senseless.Senseless! not so.So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;The one is Caius Lucius.A worthy fellow,Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;But that's no fault of his: we must receive himAccording to the honour of his sender;And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,We must extend our notice. Our dear son,When you have given good morning to your mistress,Attend the queen and us; we shall have needTo employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,Let her lie still and dream.By your leave, ho!I Know her women are about her: whatIf I do line one of their hands? 'Tis goldWhich buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makesDiana's rangers false themselves, yield upTheir deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis goldWhich makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: whatCan it not do and undo? I will makeOne of her women lawyer to me, forI yet not understand the case myself.By your leave.Who's there that knocks?A gentleman.No more?Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.That's moreThan some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?Your lady's person: is she ready?Ay,To keep her chamber.There is gold for you;Sell me your good report.How! my good name? or to report of youWhat I shall think is good?--The princess!Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much painsFor purchasing but trouble; the thanks I giveIs telling you that I am poor of thanksAnd scarce can spare them.Still, I swear I love you.If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:If you swear still, your recompense is stillThat I regard it not.This is no answer.But that you shall not say I yield being silent,I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,I shall unfold equal discourtesyTo your best kindness: one of your great knowingShould learn, being taught, forbearance.To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:I will not.Fools are not mad folks.Do you call me fool?As I am mad, I do:If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,You put me to forget a lady's manners,By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,By the very truth of it, I care not for you,And am so near the lack of charity--To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had ratherYou felt than make't my boast.You sin againstObedience, which you owe your father. ForThe contract you pretend with that base wretch,One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,On whom there is no more dependencyBut brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement byThe consequence o' the crown, and must not soilThe precious note of it with a base slave.A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,A pantler, not so eminent.Profane fellowWert thou the son of Jupiter and no moreBut what thou art besides, thou wert too baseTo be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,Even to the point of envy, if 'twere madeComparative for your virtues, to be styledThe under-hangman of his kingdom, and hatedFor being preferred so well.The south-fog rot him!He never can meet more mischance than comeTo be but named of thee. His meanest garment,That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearerIn my respect than all the hairs above thee,Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!'His garment!' Now the devil--To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--'His garment!'I am sprited with a fool.Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my womanSearch for a jewel that too casuallyHath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,If I would lose it for a revenueOf any king's in Europe. I do thinkI saw't this morning: confident I amLast night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:I hope it be not gone to tell my lordThat I kiss aught but he.'Twill not be lost.I hope so: go and search.You have abused me:'His meanest garment!'Ay, I said so, sir:If you will make't an action, call witness to't.I will inform your father.Your mother too:She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,To the worst of discontent.I'll be revenged:'His meanest garment!' Well.CYMBELINE
