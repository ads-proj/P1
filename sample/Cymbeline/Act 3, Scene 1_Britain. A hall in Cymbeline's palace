Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yetLives in men's eyes and will to ears and tonguesBe theme and hearing ever, was in this BritainAnd conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit lessThan in his feats deserving it--for himAnd his succession granted Rome a tribute,Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee latelyIs left untender'd.And, to kill the marvel,Shall be so ever.There be many Caesars,Ere such another Julius. Britain isA world by itself; and we will nothing payFor wearing our own noses.That opportunityWhich then they had to take from 's, to resumeWe have again. Remember, sir, my liege,The kings your ancestors, together withThe natural bravery of your isle, which standsAs Neptune's park, ribbed and paled inWith rocks unscalable and roaring waters,With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquestCaesar made here; but made not here his bragOf 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--That first that ever touch'd him--he was carriedFrom off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'dAs easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereofThe famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires brightAnd Britons strut with courage.Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: ourkingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other ofthem may have crook'd noses, but to owe suchstraight arms, none.Son, let your mother end.We have yet many among us can gripe as hard asCassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have ahand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? IfCaesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, orput the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tributefor light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.You must know,Till the injurious Romans did extortThis tribute from us, we were free:Caesar's ambition,Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretchThe sides o' the world, against all colour hereDid put the yoke upon 's; which to shake offBecomes a warlike people, whom we reckonOurselves to be.We do.Say, then, to Caesar,Our ancestor was that Mulmutius whichOrdain'd our laws, whose use the sword of CaesarHath too much mangled; whose repair and franchiseShall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,Who was the first of Britain which did putHis brows within a golden crown and call'dHimself a king.I am sorry, Cymbeline,That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--Caesar, that hath more kings his servants thanThyself domestic officers--thine enemy:Receive it from me, then: war and confusionIn Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: lookFor fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,I thank thee for myself.Thou art welcome, Caius.Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spentMuch under him; of him I gather'd honour;Which he to seek of me again, perforce,Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfectThat the Pannonians and Dalmatians forTheir liberties are now in arms; a precedentWhich not to read would show the Britons cold:So Caesar shall not find them.Let proof speak.His majesty bids you welcome. Makepastime with us a day or two, or longer: ifyou seek us afterwards in other terms, youshall find us in our salt-water girdle: if youbeat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall inthe adventure, our crows shall fare the betterfor you; and there's an end.So, sir.I know your master's pleasure and he mine:All the remain is 'Welcome!'
