Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed thejack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had ahundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapesmust take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mineoaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.What got he by that? You have broke his pate withyour bowl.[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it,it would have run all out.When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not forany standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?No my lord;nor crop the ears of them.Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?Would he had been one of my rank![Aside]  To have smelt like a fool.I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: apox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;they dare not fight with me, because of the queen mymother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful offighting, and I must go up and down like a cock thatnobody can match.[Aside]  You are cock and capon too; and you crow,cock, with your comb on.Sayest thou?It is not fit your lordship should undertake everycompanion that you give offence to.No, I know that: but it is fit I should commitoffence to my inferiors.Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.Why, so I say.Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?A stranger, and I not know on't![Aside]  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows itnot.There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one ofLeonatus' friends.Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?One of your lordship's pages.Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there noderogation in't?You cannot derogate, my lord.Not easily, I think.[Aside]  You are a fool granted; therefore yourissues, being foolish, do not derogate.Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lostto-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.I'll attend your lordship.That such a crafty devil as is his motherShould yield the world this ass! a woman thatBears all down with her brain; and this her sonCannot take two from twenty, for his heart,And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,A mother hourly coining plots, a wooerMore hateful than the foul expulsion isOf thy dear husband, than that horrid actOf the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firmThe walls of thy dear honour, keep unshakedThat temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!
