Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sureTo win the king as I am bold her honourWill remain hers.What means do you make to him?Not any, but abide the change of time,Quake in the present winter's state and wishThat warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,I barely gratify your love; they failing,I must die much your debtor.Your very goodness and your companyO'erpays all I can do. By this, your kingHath heard of great Augustus: Caius LuciusWill do's commission throughly: and I thinkHe'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,Or look upon our Romans, whose remembranceIs yet fresh in their grief.I do believe,Statist though I am none, nor like to be,That this will prove a war; and you shall hearThe legions now in Gallia sooner landedIn our not-fearing Britain than have tidingsOf any penny tribute paid. Our countrymenAre men more order'd than when Julius CaesarSmiled at their lack of skill, but foundtheir courageWorthy his frowning at: their discipline,Now mingled with their courages, will make knownTo their approvers they are people suchThat mend upon the world.See! Iachimo!The swiftest harts have posted you by land;And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,To make your vessel nimble.Welcome, sir.I hope the briefness of your answer madeThe speediness of your return.Your ladyIs one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.And therewithal the best; or let her beautyLook through a casement to allure false heartsAnd be false with them.Here are letters for you.Their tenor good, I trust.'Tis very like.Was Caius Lucius in the Britain courtWhen you were there?He was expected then,But not approach'd.All is well yet.Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't notToo dull for your good wearing?If I had lost it,I should have lost the worth of it in gold.I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoyA second night of such sweet shortness whichWas mine in Britain, for the ring is won.The stone's too hard to come by.Not a whit,Your lady being so easy.Make not, sir,Your loss your sport: I hope you know that weMust not continue friends.Good sir, we must,If you keep covenant. Had I not broughtThe knowledge of your mistress home, I grantWe were to question further: but I nowProfess myself the winner of her honour,Together with your ring; and not the wrongerOf her or you, having proceeded butBy both your wills.If you can make't apparentThat you have tasted her in bed, my handAnd ring is yours; if not, the foul opinionYou had of her pure honour gains or losesYour sword or mine, or masterless leaves bothTo who shall find them.Sir, my circumstances,Being so near the truth as I will make them,Must first induce you to believe: whose strengthI will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall findYou need it not.Proceed.First, her bedchamber,--Where, I confess, I slept not, but professHad that was well worth watching--it was hang'dWith tapesty of silk and silver; the storyProud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or forThe press of boats or pride: a piece of workSo bravely done, so rich, that it did striveIn workmanship and value; which I wonder'dCould be so rarely and exactly wrought,Since the true life on't was--This is true;And this you might have heard of here, by me,Or by some other.More particularsMust justify my knowledge.So they must,Or do your honour injury.The chimneyIs south the chamber, and the chimney-pieceChaste Dian bathing: never saw I figuresSo likely to report themselves: the cutterWas as another nature, dumb; outwent her,Motion and breath left out.This is a thingWhich you might from relation likewise reap,Being, as it is, much spoke of.The roof o' the chamberWith golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--I had forgot them--were two winking CupidsOf silver, each on one foot standing, nicelyDepending on their brands.This is her honour!Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praiseBe given to your remembrance--the descriptionOf what is in her chamber nothing savesThe wager you have laid.Then, if you can,Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!And now 'tis up again: it must be marriedTo that your diamond; I'll keep them.Jove!Once more let me behold it: is it thatWhich I left with her?Sir--I thank her--that:She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;Her pretty action did outsell her gift,And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and saidShe prized it once.May be she pluck'd it offTo send it me.She writes so to you, doth she?O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;It is a basilisk unto mine eye,Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honourWhere there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,Where there's another man: the vows of womenOf no more bondage be, to where they are made,Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.O, above measure false!Have patience, sir,And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:It may be probable she lost it; orWho knows if one of her women, being corrupted,Hath stol'n it from her?Very true;And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:Render to me some corporal sign about her,More evident than this; for this was stolen.By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sureShe would not lose it: her attendants areAll sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:The cognizance of her incontinencyIs this: she hath bought the name of whorethus dearly.There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hellDivide themselves between you!Sir, be patient:This is not strong enough to be believedOf one persuaded well of--Never talk on't;She hath been colted by him.If you seekFor further satisfying, under her breast--Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proudOf that most delicate lodging: by my life,I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hungerTo feed again, though full. You do rememberThis stain upon her?Ay, and it doth confirmAnother stain, as big as hell can hold,Were there no more but it.Will you hear more?Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;Once, and a million!I'll be sworn--No swearing.If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;And I will kill thee, if thou dost denyThou'st made me cuckold.I'll deny nothing.O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!I will go there and do't, i' the court, beforeHer father. I'll do something--Quite besidesThe government of patience! You have won:Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrathHe hath against himself.With an my heart.
