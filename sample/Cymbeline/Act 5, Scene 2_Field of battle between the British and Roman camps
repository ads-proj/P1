The heaviness and guilt within my bosomTakes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,The princess of this country, and the air on'tRevengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,A very drudge of nature's, have subdued meIn my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borneAs I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.If that thy gentry, Britain, go beforeThis lout as he exceeds our lords, the oddsIs that we scarce are men and you are gods.Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;The lane is guarded: nothing routs us butThe villany of our fears.Stand, stand, and fight!Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;For friends kill friends, and the disorder's suchAs war were hoodwink'd.'Tis their fresh supplies.It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimesLet's reinforce, or fly.
