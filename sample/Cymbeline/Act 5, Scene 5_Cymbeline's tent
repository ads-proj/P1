Stand by my side, you whom the gods have madePreservers of my throne. Woe is my heartThat the poor soldier that so richly fought,Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breastStepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:He shall be happy that can find him, ifOur grace can make him so.I never sawSuch noble fury in so poor a thing;Such precious deeds in one that promises noughtBut beggary and poor looks.No tidings of him?He hath been search'd among the dead and living,But no trace of him.To my grief, I amThe heir of his reward;which I will addTo you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the timeTo ask of whence you are. Report it.Sir,In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:Further to boast were neither true nor modest,Unless I add, we are honest.Bow your knees.Arise my knights o' the battle: I create youCompanions to our person and will fit youWith dignities becoming your estates.There's business in these faces. Why so sadlyGreet you our victory? you look like Romans,And not o' the court of Britain.Hail, great king!To sour your happiness, I must reportThe queen is dead.Who worse than a physicianWould this report become? But I consider,By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet deathWill seize the doctor too. How ended she?With horror, madly dying, like her life,Which, being cruel to the world, concludedMost cruel to herself. What she confess'dI will report, so please you: these her womenCan trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeksWere present when she finish'd.Prithee, say.First, she confess'd she never loved you, onlyAffected greatness got by you, not you:Married your royalty, was wife to your place;Abhorr'd your person.She alone knew this;And, but she spoke it dying, I would notBelieve her lips in opening it. Proceed.Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to loveWith such integrity, she did confessWas as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,But that her flight prevented it, she hadTa'en off by poison.O most delicate fiend!Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?More, sir, and worse. She did confess she hadFor you a mortal mineral; which, being took,Should by the minute feed on life and lingeringBy inches waste you: in which time she purposed,By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, toO'ercome you with her show, and in time,When she had fitted you with her craft, to workHer son into the adoption of the crown:But, failing of her end by his strange absence,Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despiteOf heaven and men, her purposes; repentedThe evils she hatch'd were not effected; soDespairing died.Heard you all this, her women?We did, so please your highness.Mine eyesWere not in fault, for she was beautiful;Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,That thought her like her seeming; it hadbeen viciousTo have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute thatThe Britons have razed out, though with the lossOf many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suitThat their good souls may be appeased with slaughterOf you their captives, which ourself have granted:So think of your estate.Consider, sir, the chance of war: the dayWas yours by accident; had it gone with us,We should not, when the blood was cool,have threaten'dOur prisoners with the sword. But since the godsWill have it thus, that nothing but our livesMay be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficethA Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:Augustus lives to think on't: and so muchFor my peculiar care. This one thing onlyI will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,Let him be ransom'd: never master hadA page so kind, so duteous, diligent,So tender over his occasions, true,So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue joinWith my request, which I make bold your highnessCannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,And spare no blood beside.I have surely seen him:His favour is familiar to me. Boy,Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,The noblest ta'en.I humbly thank your highness.I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;And yet I know thou wilt.No, no: alack,There's other work in hand: I see a thingBitter to me as death: your life, good master,Must shuffle for itself.The boy disdains me,He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joysThat place them on the truth of girls and boys.Why stands he so perplex'd?What wouldst thou, boy?I love thee more and more: think more and moreWhat's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?He is a Roman; no more kin to meThan I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,Am something nearer.Wherefore eyest him so?I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you pleaseTo give me hearing.Ay, with all my heart,And lend my best attention. What's thy name?Fidele, sir.Thou'rt my good youth, my page;I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.Is not this boy revived from death?One sand anotherNot more resembles that sweet rosy ladWho died, and was Fidele. What think you?The same dead thing alive.Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sureHe would have spoke to us.But we saw him dead.Be silent; let's see further.[Aside]	It is my mistress:Since she is living, let the time run onTo good or bad.Come, stand thou by our side;Make thy demand aloud.Sir, step you forth;Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,Which is our honour, bitter torture shallWinnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.My boon is, that this gentleman may renderOf whom he had this ring.[Aside]                 What's that to him?That diamond upon your finger, sayHow came it yours?Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken thatWhich, to be spoke, would torture thee.How! me?I am glad to be constrain'd to utter thatWhich torments me to conceal. By villanyI got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;Whom thou didst banish; and--which more maygrieve thee,As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?All that belongs to this.That paragon, thy daughter,--For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spiritsQuail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:I had rather thou shouldst live while nature willThan die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.Upon a time,--unhappy was the clockThat struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursedThe mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, wouldOur viands had been poison'd, or at leastThose which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--What should I say? he was too good to beWhere ill men were; and was the best of allAmongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,Hearing us praise our loves of ItalyFor beauty that made barren the swell'd boastOf him that best could speak, for feature, lamingThe shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,A shop of all the qualities that manLoves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,Fairness which strikes the eye--I stand on fire:Come to the matter.All too soon I shall,Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,Most like a noble lord in love and oneThat had a royal lover, took his hint;And, not dispraising whom we praised,--thereinHe was as calm as virtue--he beganHis mistress' picture; which by his tonguebeing made,And then a mind put in't, either our bragsWere crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his descriptionProved us unspeaking sots.Nay, nay, to the purpose.Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with himPieces of gold 'gainst this which then he woreUpon his honour'd finger, to attainIn suit the place of's bed and win this ringBy hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,No lesser of her honour confidentThan I did truly find her, stakes this ring;And would so, had it been a carbuncleOf Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had itBeen all the worth of's car. Away to BritainPost I in this design: well may you, sir,Remember me at court; where I was taughtOf your chaste daughter the wide difference'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'dOf hope, not longing, mine Italian brain'Gan in your duller Britain operateMost vilely; for my vantage, excellent:And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,That I return'd with simular proof enoughTo make the noble Leonatus mad,By wounding his belief in her renownWith tokens thus, and thus; averting notesOf chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marksOf secret on her person, that he could notBut think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--Methinks, I see him now--[Advancing]             Ay, so thou dost,Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,Egregious murderer, thief, any thingThat's due to all the villains past, in being,To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send outFor torturers ingenious: it is IThat all the abhorred things o' the earth amendBy being worse than they. I am Posthumus,That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--That caused a lesser villain than myself,A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the templeOf virtue was she; yea, and she herself.Spit, and throw stone s, cast mire upon me, setThe dogs o' the street to bay me: every villainBe call'd Posthumus Leonitus; andBe villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,Imogen, Imogen!Peace, my lord; hear, hear--Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,There lie thy part.O, gentlemen, help!Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!Mine honour'd lady!Does the world go round?How come these staggers on me?Wake, my mistress!If this be so, the gods do mean to strike meTo death with mortal joy.How fares thy mistress?O, get thee from my sight;Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!Breathe not where princes are.The tune of Imogen!Lady,The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, ifThat box I gave you was not thought by meA precious thing: I had it from the queen.New matter still?It poison'd me.O gods!I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.Which must approve thee honest: 'If PisanioHave,' said she, 'given his mistress that confectionWhich I gave him for cordial, she is servedAs I would serve a rat.'What's this, Comelius?The queen, sir, very oft importuned meTo temper poisons for her, still pretendingThe satisfaction of her knowledge onlyIn killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purposeWas of more danger, did compound for herA certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would ceaseThe present power of life, but in short timeAll offices of nature should againDo their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?Most like I did, for I was dead.My boys,There was our error.This is, sure, Fidele.Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?Think that you are upon a rock; and nowThrow me again.Hang there like a fruit, my soul,Till the tree die!How now, my flesh, my child!What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?Wilt thou not speak to me?[Kneeling]               Your blessing, sir.[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]  Though you did lovethis youth, I blame ye not:You had a motive for't.My tears that fallProve holy water on thee! Imogen,Thy mother's dead.I am sorry for't, my lord.O, she was nought; and long of her it wasThat we meet here so strangely: but her sonIs gone, we know not how nor where.My lord,Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,Upon my lady's missing, came to meWith his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,If I discover'd not which way she was gone,It was my instant death. By accident,had a feigned letter of my master'sThen in my pocket; which directed himTo seek her on the mountains near to Milford;Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,Which he enforced from me, away he postsWith unchaste purpose and with oath to violateMy lady's honour: what became of himI further know not.Let me end the story:I slew him there.Marry, the gods forfend!I would not thy good deeds should from my lipsPluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,Deny't again.I have spoke it, and I did it.He was a prince.A most incivil one: the wrongs he did meWere nothing prince-like; for he did provoke meWith language that would make me spurn the sea,If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;And am right glad he is not standing hereTo tell this tale of mine.I am sorry for thee:By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and mustEndure our law: thou'rt dead.That headless manI thought had been my lord.Bind the offender,And take him from our presence.Stay, sir king:This man is better than the man he slew,As well descended as thyself; and hathMore of thee merited than a band of ClotensHad ever scar for.Let his arms alone;They were not born for bondage.Why, old soldier,Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,By tasting of our wrath? How of descentAs good as we?In that he spake too far.And thou shalt die for't.We will die all three:But I will prove that two on's are as goodAs I have given out him. My sons, I must,For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,Though, haply, well for you.Your danger's ours.And our good his.Have at it then, by leave.Thou hadst, great king, a subject whoWas call'd Belarius.What of him? he isA banish'd traitor.He it is that hathAssumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;I know not how a traitor.Take him hence:The whole world shall not save him.Not too hot:First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;And let it be confiscate all, so soonAs I have received it.Nursing of my sons!I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,These two young gentlemen, that call me fatherAnd think they are my sons, are none of mine;They are the issue of your loins, my liege,And blood of your begetting.How! my issue!So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishmentItself, and all my treason; that I suffer'dWas all the harm I did. These gentle princes--For such and so they are--these twenty yearsHave I train'd up: those arts they have as ICould put into them; my breeding was, sir, asYour highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these childrenUpon my banishment: I moved her to't,Having received the punishment before,For that which I did then: beaten for loyaltyExcited me to treason: their dear loss,The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shapedUnto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,Here are your sons again; and I must loseTwo of the sweet'st companions in the world.The benediction of these covering heavensFall on their heads like dew! for they are worthyTo inlay heaven with stars.Thou weep'st, and speak'st.The service that you three have done is moreUnlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:If these be they, I know not how to wishA pair of worthier sons.Be pleased awhile.This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'dIn a most curious mantle, wrought by the handOf his queen mother, which for more probationI can with ease produce.Guiderius hadUpon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;It was a mark of wonder.This is he;Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:It was wise nature's end in the donation,To be his evidence now.O, what, am IA mother to the birth of three? Ne'er motherRejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,That, after this strange starting from your orbs,may reign in them now! O Imogen,Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.No, my lord;I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,Have we thus met? O, never say hereafterBut I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,When I was but your sister; I you brothers,When ye were so indeed.Did you e'er meet?Ay, my good lord.And at first meeting loved;Continued so, until we thought he died.By the queen's dram she swallow'd.O rare instinct!When shall I hear all through? This fierceabridgementHath to it circumstantial branches, whichDistinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?And when came you to serve our Roman captive?How parted with your brothers? how first met them?Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,And your three motives to the battle, withI know not how much more, should be demanded;And all the other by-dependencies,From chance to chance: but nor the time nor placeWill serve our long inter'gatories. See,Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eyeOn him, her brother, me, her master, hittingEach object with a joy: the counterchangeIs severally in all. Let's quit this ground,And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.You are my father too, and did relieve me,To see this gracious season.All o'erjoy'd,Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,For they shall taste our comfort.My good master,I will yet do you service.Happy be you!The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,He would have well becomed this place, and gracedThe thankings of a king.I am, sir,The soldier that did company these threeIn poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment forThe purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and mightHave made you finish.[Kneeling]          I am down again:But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,Which I so often owe: but your ring first;And here the bracelet of the truest princessThat ever swore her faith.Kneel not to me:The power that I have on you is, to spare you;The malice towards you to forgive you: live,And deal with others better.Nobly doom'd!We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;Pardon's the word to all.You holp us, sir,As you did mean indeed to be our brother;Joy'd are we that you are.Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methoughtGreat Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,Appear'd to me, with other spritely showsOf mine own kindred: when I waked, I foundThis label on my bosom; whose containingIs so from sense in hardness, that I canMake no collection of it: let him showHis skill in the construction.Philarmonus!Here, my good lord.Read, and declare the meaning.[Reads]  'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himselfunknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by apiece of tender air; and when from a stately cedarshall be lopped branches, which, being dead manyyears, shall after revive, be jointed to the oldstock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus endhis miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish inpeace and plenty.'Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;The fit and apt construction of thy name,Being Leonatus, doth import so much.The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divineIs this most constant wife; who, even now,Answering the letter of the oracle,Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd aboutWith this most tender air.This hath some seeming.The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches pointThy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,For many years thought dead, are now revived,To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issuePromises Britain peace and plenty.WellMy peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,And to the Roman empire; promisingTo pay our wonted tribute, from the whichWe were dissuaded by our wicked queen;Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,Have laid most heavy hand.The fingers of the powers above do tuneThe harmony of this peace. The visionWhich I made known to Lucius, ere the strokeOf this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instantIs full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,From south to west on wing soaring aloft,Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sunSo vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,The imperial Caesar, should again uniteHis favour with the radiant Cymbeline,Which shines here in the west.Laud we the gods;And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrilsFrom our blest altars. Publish we this peaceTo all our subjects. Set we forward: letA Roman and a British ensign waveFriendly together: so through Lud's-town march:And in the temple of great JupiterOur peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.Set on there! Never was a war did cease,Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
