Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.A fever with the absence of her son,A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,The great part of my comfort, gone; my queenUpon a desperate bed, and in a timeWhen fearful wars point at me; her son gone,So needful for this present: it strikes me, pastThe hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,Who needs must know of her departure andDost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from theeBy a sharp torture.Sir, my life is yours;I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,I nothing know where she remains, why gone,Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,Hold me your loyal servant.Good my liege,The day that she was missing he was here:I dare be bound he's true and shall performAll parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,There wants no diligence in seeking him,And will, no doubt, be found.The time is troublesome.We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousyDoes yet depend.So please your majesty,The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,Are landed on your coast, with a supplyOf Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.Now for the counsel of my son and queen!I am amazed with matter.Good my liege,Your preparation can affront no lessThan what you hear of: come more, for moreyou're ready:The want is but to put those powers in motionThat long to move.I thank you. Let's withdraw;And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear notWhat can from Italy annoy us; butWe grieve at chances here. Away!I heard no letter from my master sinceI wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:Nor hear I from my mistress who did promiseTo yield me often tidings: neither know IWhat is betid to Cloten; but remainPerplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.These present wars shall find I love my country,Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.
