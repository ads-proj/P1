The noise is round about us.Let us from it.What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock itFrom action and adventure?Nay, what hopeHave we in hiding us? This way, the RomansMust or for Britons slay us, or receive usFor barbarous and unnatural revoltsDuring their use, and slay us after.Sons,We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.To the king's party there's no going: newnessOf Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'dAmong the bands--may drive us to a renderWhere we have lived, and so extort from's thatWhich we have done, whose answer would be deathDrawn on with torture.This is, sir, a doubtIn such a time nothing becoming you,Nor satisfying us.It is not likelyThat when they hear the Roman horses neigh,Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyesAnd ears so cloy'd importantly as now,That they will waste their time upon our note,To know from whence we are.O, I am knownOf many in the army: many years,Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore himFrom my remembrance. And, besides, the kingHath not deserved my service nor your loves;Who find in my exile the want of breeding,The certainty of this hard life; aye hopelessTo have the courtesy your cradle promised,But to be still hot summer's tamings andThe shrinking slaves of winter.Than be soBetter to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:I and my brother are not known; yourselfSo out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,Cannot be question'd.By this sun that shines,I'll thither: what thing is it that I neverDid see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!Never bestrid a horse, save one that hadA rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowelNor iron on his heel! I am ashamedTo look upon the holy sun, to haveThe benefit of his blest beams, remainingSo long a poor unknown.By heavens, I'll go:If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,I'll take the better care, but if you will not,The hazard therefore due fall on me byThe hands of Romans!So say I	amen.No reason I, since of your lives you setSo slight a valuation, should reserveMy crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!If in your country wars you chance to die,That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:Lead, lead.The time seems long; their bloodthinks scorn,Till it fly out and show them princes born.
