A goodly day not to keep house, with suchWhose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gateInstructs you how to adore the heavens and bows youTo a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchsAre arch'd so high that giants may jet throughAnd keep their impious turbans on, withoutGood morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardlyAs prouder livers do.Hail, heaven!Hail, heaven!Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,When you above perceive me like a crow,That it is place which lessens and sets off;And you may then revolve what tales I have told youOf courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:This service is not service, so being done,But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,Draws us a profit from all things we see;And often, to our comfort, shall we findThe sharded beetle in a safer holdThan is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this lifeIs nobler than attending for a cheque,Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know notWhat air's from home. Haply this life is best,If quiet life be best; sweeter to youThat have a sharper known; well correspondingWith your stiff age: but unto us it isA cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;A prison for a debtor, that not daresTo stride a limit.What should we speak ofWhen we are old as you? when we shall hearThe rain and wind beat dark December, how,In this our pinching cave, shall we discourseThe freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;Our valour is to chase what flies; our cageWe make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,And sing our bondage freely.How you speak!Did you but know the city's usuriesAnd felt them knowingly; the art o' the courtAs hard to leave as keep; whose top to climbIs certain falling, or so slippery thatThe fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,A pain that only seems to seek out dangerI' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'the search,And hath as oft a slanderous epitaphAs record of fair act; nay, many times,Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this storyThe world may read in me: my body's mark'dWith Roman swords, and my report was onceFirst with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,And when a soldier was the theme, my nameWas not far off: then was I as a treeWhose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,A storm or robbery, call it what you will,Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,And left me bare to weather.Uncertain favour!My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'dBefore my perfect honour, swore to CymbelineI was confederate with the Romans: soFollow'd my banishment, and this twenty yearsThis rock and these demesnes have been my world;Where I have lived at honest freedom, paidMore pious debts to heaven than in allThe fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!This is not hunters' language: he that strikesThe venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;To him the other two shall minister;And we will fear no poison, which attendsIn place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!These boys know little they are sons to the king;Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.They think they are mine; and though train'dup thus meanlyI' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hitThe roofs of palaces, and nature prompts themIn simple and low things to prince it muchBeyond the trick of others. This Polydore,The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, whoThe king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!When on my three-foot stool I sit and tellThe warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly outInto my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even thenThe princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,Strains his young nerves and puts himself in postureThat acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,Strikes life into my speech and shows much moreHis own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knowsThou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,At three and two years old, I stole these babes;Thinking to bar thee of succession, asThou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,Thou wast their nurse; they took thee fortheir mother,And every day do honour to her grave:Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,They take for natural father. The game is up.
