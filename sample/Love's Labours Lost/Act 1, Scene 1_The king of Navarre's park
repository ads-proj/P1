Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,Live register'd upon our brazen tombsAnd then grace us in the disgrace of death;When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,The endeavor of this present breath may buyThat honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edgeAnd make us heirs of all eternity.Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,That war against your own affectionsAnd the huge army of the world's desires,--Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;Our court shall be a little Academe,Still and contemplative in living art.You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,Have sworn for three years' term to live with meMy fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutesThat are recorded in this schedule here:Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,That his own hand may strike his honour downThat violates the smallest branch herein:If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bitsMake rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:The grosser manner of these world's delightsHe throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;With all these living in philosophy.I can but say their protestation over;So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,That is, to live and study here three years.But there are other strict observances;As, not to see a woman in that term,Which I hope well is not enrolled there;And one day in a week to touch no foodAnd but one meal on every day beside,The which I hope is not enrolled there;And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,And not be seen to wink of all the day--When I was wont to think no harm all nightAnd make a dark night too of half the day--Which I hope well is not enrolled there:O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:I only swore to study with your graceAnd stay here in your court for three years' space.You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.What is the end of study? let me know.Why, that to know, which else we should not know.Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.Come on, then; I will swear to study so,To know the thing I am forbid to know:As thus,--to study where I well may dine,When I to feast expressly am forbid;Or study where to meet some mistress fine,When mistresses from common sense are hid;Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,Study to break it and not break my troth.If study's gain be thus and this be so,Study knows that which yet it doth not know:Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.These be the stops that hinder study quiteAnd train our intellects to vain delight.Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:As, painfully to pore upon a bookTo seek the light of truth; while truth the whileDoth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.Study me how to please the eye indeedBy fixing it upon a fairer eye,Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heedAnd give him light that it was blinded by.Study is like the heaven's glorious sunThat will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:Small have continual plodders ever wonSave base authority from others' booksThese earthly godfathers of heaven's lightsThat give a name to every fixed starHave no more profit of their shining nightsThan those that walk and wot not what they are.Too much to know is to know nought but fame;And every godfather can give a name.How well he's read, to reason against reading!Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.How follows that?Fit in his place and time.In reason nothing.Something then in rhyme.Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,That bites the first-born infants of the spring.Well, say I am; why should proud summer boastBefore the birds have any cause to sing?Why should I joy in any abortive birth?At Christmas I no more desire a roseThan wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;But like of each thing that in season grows.So you, to study now it is too late,Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:And though I have for barbarism spoke moreThan for that angel knowledge you can say,Yet confident I'll keep what I have sworeAnd bide the penance of each three years' day.Give me the paper; let me read the same;And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.How well this yielding rescues thee from shame![Reads]  'Item, That no woman shall come within amile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?Four days ago.Let's see the penalty.'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?Marry, that did I.Sweet lord, and why?To fright them hence with that dread penalty.A dangerous law against gentility!'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a womanwithin the term of three years, he shall endure suchpublic shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'This article, my liege, yourself must break;For well you know here comes in embassyThe French king's daughter with yourself to speak--A maid of grace and complete majesty--About surrender up of AquitaineTo her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:Therefore this article is made in vain,Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.So study evermore is overshot:While it doth study to have what it wouldIt doth forget to do the thing it should,And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.We must of force dispense with this decree;She must lie here on mere necessity.Necessity will make us all forswornThree thousand times within this three years' space;For every man with his affects is born,Not by might master'd but by special grace:If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'So to the laws at large I write my name:And he that breaks them in the least degreeStands in attainder of eternal shame:Suggestions are to other as to me;But I believe, although I seem so loath,I am the last that will last keep his oath.But is there no quick recreation granted?Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is hauntedWith a refined traveller of Spain;A man in all the world's new fashion planted,That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;One whom the music of his own vain tongueDoth ravish like enchanting harmony;A man of complements, whom right and wrongHave chose as umpire of their mutiny:This child of fancy, that Armado hight,For interim to our studies shall relateIn high-born words the worth of many a knightFrom tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;But, I protest, I love to hear him lieAnd I will use him for my minstrelsy.Armado is a most illustrious wight,A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;And so to study, three years is but short.Which is the duke's own person?This, fellow: what wouldst?I myself reprehend his own person, for I am hisgrace's tharborough: but I would see his own personin flesh and blood.This is he.Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villanyabroad: this letter will tell you more.Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.A letter from the magnificent Armado.How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!To hear? or forbear laughing?To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or toforbear both.Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause toclimb in the merriness.The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.In what manner?In manner and form following, sir; all those three:I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting withher upon the form, and taken following her into thepark; which, put together, is in manner and formfollowing. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is themanner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--in some form.For the following, sir?As it shall follow in my correction: and God defendthe right!Will you hear this letter with attention?As we would hear an oracle.Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.[Reads]  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent andsole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,and body's fostering patron.'Not a word of Costard yet.[Reads]  'So it is,'--It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, intelling true, but so.Peace!Be to me and every man that dares not fight!No words!Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.[Reads]  'So it is, besieged with sable-colouredmelancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humourto the most wholesome physic of thy health-givingair; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself towalk.

But, sirrah, what sayyou to this?Sir, I confess the wench.Did you hear the proclamation?I do confess much of the hearing it but little ofthe marking of it.It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be takenwith a wench.I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.This maid will not serve your turn, sir.This maid will serve my turn, sir.Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fasta week with bran and water.I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.And Don Armado shall be your keeper.My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:And go we, lords, to put in practise thatWhich each to other hath so strongly sworn.I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.Sirrah, come on.I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I wastaken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a truegirl; and therefore welcome the sour cup ofprosperity!
