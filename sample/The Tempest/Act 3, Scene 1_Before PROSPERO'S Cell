There be some sports are painful, and their labourDelight in them sets off: some kinds of basenessAre nobly undergone and most poor mattersPoint to rich ends. This my mean taskWould be as heavy to me as odious, butThe mistress which I serve quickens what's deadAnd makes my labours pleasures: O, she isTen times more gentle than her father's crabbed,And he's composed of harshness. I must removeSome thousands of these logs and pile them up,Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistressWeeps when she sees me work, and says, such basenessHad never like executor. I forget:But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,Most busy lest, when I do it.Alas, now, pray you,Work not so hard: I would the lightning hadBurnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,'Twill weep for having wearied you. My fatherIs hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;He's safe for these three hours.O most dear mistress,The sun will set before I shall dischargeWhat I must strive to do.If you'll sit down,I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;I'll carry it to the pile.No, precious creature;I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,Than you should such dishonour undergo,While I sit lazy by.It would become meAs well as it does you: and I should do itWith much more ease; for my good will is to it,And yours it is against.Poor worm, thou art infected!This visitation shows it.You look wearily.No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with meWhen you are by at night. I do beseech you--Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--What is your name?Miranda.--O my father,I have broke your hest to say so!Admired Miranda!Indeed the top of admiration! worthWhat's dearest to the world! Full many a ladyI have eyed with best regard and many a timeThe harmony of their tongues hath into bondageBrought my too diligent ear: for several virtuesHave I liked several women; never anyWith so fun soul, but some defect in herDid quarrel with the noblest grace she owedAnd put it to the foil: but you, O you,So perfect and so peerless, are createdOf every creature's best!I do not knowOne of my sex; no woman's face remember,Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seenMore that I may call men than you, good friend,And my dear father: how features are abroad,I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,The jewel in my dower, I would not wishAny companion in the world but you,Nor can imagination form a shape,Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattleSomething too wildly and my father's preceptsI therein do forget.I am in my conditionA prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;I would, not so!--and would no more endureThis wooden slavery than to sufferThe flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:The very instant that I saw you, didMy heart fly to your service; there resides,To make me slave to it; and for your sakeAm I this patient log--man.Do you love me?O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this soundAnd crown what I profess with kind eventIf I speak true! if hollowly, invertWhat best is boded me to mischief! IBeyond all limit of what else i' the worldDo love, prize, honour you.I am a foolTo weep at what I am glad of.Fair encounterOf two most rare affections! Heavens rain graceOn that which breeds between 'em!Wherefore weep you?At mine unworthiness that dare not offerWhat I desire to give, and much less takeWhat I shall die to want. But this is trifling;And all the more it seeks to hide itself,The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!I am your wife, if you will marry me;If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellowYou may deny me; but I'll be your servant,Whether you will or no.My mistress, dearest;And I thus humble ever.My husband, then?Ay, with a heart as willingAs bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewellTill half an hour hence.A thousand thousand!So glad of this as they I cannot be,Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicingAt nothing can be more. I'll to my book,For yet ere supper-time must I performMuch business appertaining.
