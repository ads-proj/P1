Will not King Richard let me speak with him?No, my good lord; therefore be patient.Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,Vaughan, and all that have miscarriedBy underhand corrupted foul injustice,If that your moody discontented soulsDo through the clouds behold this present hour,Even for revenge mock my destruction!This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?It is, my lord.Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.This is the day that, in King Edward's time,I wish't might fall on me, when I was foundFalse to his children or his wife's alliesThis is the day wherein I wish'd to fallBy the false faith of him I trusted most;This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soulIs the determined respite of my wrongs:That high All-Seer that I dallied withHath turn'd my feigned prayer on my headAnd given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.Thus doth he force the swords of wicked menTo turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.
