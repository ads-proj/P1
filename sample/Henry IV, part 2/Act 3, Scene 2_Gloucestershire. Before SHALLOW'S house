Come on, come on, come on, sir; give me your hand,sir, give me your hand, sir: an early stirrer, bythe rood! And how doth my good cousin Silence?Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow? and yourfairest daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!By yea and nay, sir, I dare say my cousin William isbecome a good scholar: he is at Oxford still, is he not?Indeed, sir, to my cost.A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I wasonce of Clement's Inn, where I think they willtalk of mad Shallow yet.You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.By the mass, I was called any thing; and I wouldhave done any thing indeed too, and roundly too.There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, andWill Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four suchswinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again: andI may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas wereand had the best of them all at commandment. Thenwas Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page toThomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?The same Sir John, the very same. I  see him breakSkogan's head at the court-gate, when a' was acrack not thus high: and the very same day did Ifight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that Ihave spent! and to see how many of my oldacquaintance are dead!We shall all follow, cousin.Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shalldie. How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?By my troth, I was not there.Death is certain. Is old Double of your town livingyet?Dead, sir.Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and dead! a'shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well, andbetted much money on his head. Dead! a' would haveclapped i' the clout at twelve score; and carriedyou a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and ahalf, that it would have done a man's heart good tosee. How a score of ewes now?Thereafter as they be: a score of good ewes may beworth ten pounds.And is old Double dead?Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.Good morrow, honest gentlemen: I beseech you, whichis Justice Shallow?I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of thiscounty, and one of the king's justices of th e peace:What is your good pleasure with me?My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain,Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, anda most gallant leader.He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backswordman. How doth the good knight? may I ask how mylady his wife doth?Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated thanwith a wife.It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well saidindeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and everwere, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of'accommodo' very good; a good phrase.Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase callyou it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;but I will maintain the word with my sword to be asoldier-like word, and a word of exceeding goodcommand, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when aman is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;which is an excellent thing.It is very just.Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me your goodhand, give me your worship's good hand: by mytroth, you like well and bear your years very well:welcome, good Sir John.I am glad to see you well, good Master RobertShallow: Master Surecard, as I think?No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be ofthe peace.Your good-worship is welcome.Fie! this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have youprovided me here half a dozen sufficient men?Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?Let me see them, I beseech you.Where's the roll? where's the roll? where's theroll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so:yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear asI call; let them do so, let them do so. Let mesee; where is Mouldy?Here, an't please you.What think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;young, strong, and of good friends.Is thy name Mouldy?Yea, an't please you.'Tis the more time thou wert used.Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things thatare mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith,well said, Sir John, very well said.Prick him.I was pricked well enough before, an you could havelet me alone: my old dame will be undone now forone to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you neednot to have pricked me; there are other men fitterto go out than I.Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it istime you were spent.Spent!Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you whereyou are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:Simon Shadow!Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's liketo be a cold soldier.Where's Shadow?Here, sir.Shadow, whose son art thou?My mother's son, sir.Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father'sshadow: so the son of the female is the shadow ofthe male: it is often so, indeed; but much of thefather's substance!Do you like him, Sir John?Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we havea number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.Thomas Wart!Where's he?Here, sir.Is thy name Wart?Yea, sir.Thou art a very ragged wart.Shall I prick him down, Sir John?It were superfluous; for his apparel is built uponhis back and the whole frame stands upon pins:prick him no more.Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: Icommend you well. Francis Feeble!Here, sir.What trade art thou, Feeble?A woman's tailor, sir.Shall I prick him, sir?You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ldha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes inan enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as thewrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick thewoman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.I would Wart might have gone, sir.I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightstmend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put himto a private soldier that is the leader of so manythousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.It shall suffice, sir.I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?Peter Bullcalf o' the green!Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.Here, sir.'Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalftill he roar again.O Lord! good my lord captain,--What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.What disease hast thou?A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caughtwith ringing in the king's affairs upon hiscoronation-day, sir.Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilthave away thy cold; and I will take such order thatmy friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?Here is two more called than your number, you musthave but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go inwith me to dinner.Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarrydinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all nightin the windmill in Saint George's field?No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.Ha! 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?She lives, Master Shallow.She never could away with me.Never, never; she would always say she could notabide Master Shallow.By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. Shewas then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?Old, old, Master Shallow.Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by oldNightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.That's fifty-five year ago.Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that thatthis knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner:Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend;and here's four Harry ten shillings in French crownsfor you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief behanged, sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir,I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay withmy friends; else, sir, I did not care, for mine ownpart, so much.Go to; stand aside.And, good master corporal captain, for my olddame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to doany thing about her when I am gone; and she is old,and cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir.Go to; stand aside.By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once: weowe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind:an't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so: no man istoo good to serve's prince; and let it go which wayit will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.Well said; thou'rt a good fellow.Faith, I'll bear no base mind.Come, sir, which men shall I have?Four of which you please.Sir, a word with you: I have three pound to freeMouldy and Bullcalf.Go to; well.Come, Sir John, which four will you have?Do you choose for me.Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble and Shadow.Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at hometill you are past service: and for your part,Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it: I will none of you.Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they areyour likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose aman? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me thespirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what aragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you anddischarge you with the motion of a pewterer'shammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbetson the brewer's bucket. And this same half-facedfellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents nomark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aimlevel at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor runoff! O, give me the spare men, and spare me thegreat ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: goto: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always alittle, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i'faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's atester for thee.He is not his craft's master; he doth not do itright. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay atClement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur'sshow,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'would manage you his piece thus; and a' would aboutand about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; andaway again would a' go, and again would a' come: Ishall ne'er see such a fellow.These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. Godkeep you, Master Silence: I will not use many wordswith you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thankyou: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, givethe soldiers coats.Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper youraffairs! God send us peace! At your return visitour house; let our old acquaintance be renewed;peradventure I will with ye to the court.'Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow.Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.On, Bardolph; lead the men away.As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I dosee the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, howsubject we old men are to this vice of lying! Thissame starved justice hath done nothing but prate tome of the wildness of his youth, and the feats hehath done about Turnbull Street: and every thirdword a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk'stribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like aman made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forkedradish, with a head fantastically carved upon itwith a knife: a' was so forlorn, that hisdimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as amonkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' cameever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung thosetunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard thecarmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies orhis good-nights. And now is this Vice's daggerbecome a squire, and talks as familiarly of John aGaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; andI'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in theTilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowdingamong the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John aGaunt he beat his own name; for you might havethrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; thecase of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, acourt: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'llbe acquainted with him, if I return; and it shallgo hard but I will make him a philosopher's twostones to me: if the young dace be a bait for theold pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but Imay snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.
