Before God, I am exceeding weary.Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst nothave attached one of so high blood.Faith, it does me; though it discolours thecomplexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Dothit not show vilely in me to desire small beer?Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied asto remember so weak a composition.Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,small beer. But, indeed, these humbleconsiderations make me out of love with mygreatness. What a disgrace is it to me to rememberthy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or totake note how many pair of silk stockings thouhast, viz. these, and those that were thypeach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thyshirts, as, one for superfluity, and another foruse! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows betterthan I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee whenthou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not donea great while, because the rest of thy lowcountries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruinsof thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but themidwives say the children are not in the fault;whereupon the world increases, and kindreds aremightily strengthened.How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many goodyoung princes would do so, their fathers being sosick as yours at this time is?Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that youwill tell.Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should besad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tellthee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of abetter, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sadindeed too.Very hardly upon such a subject.By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil'sbook as thou and Falstaff for obduracy andpersistency: let the end try the man. But I tellthee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is sosick: and keeping such vile company as thou arthath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.The reason?What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.It would be every man's thought; and thou art ablessed fellow to think as every man thinks: nevera man's thought in the world keeps the road-waybetter than thine: every man would think me anhypocrite indeed. And what accites your mostworshipful thought to think so?Why, because you have been so lewd and so muchengraffed to Falstaff.And to thee.By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear itwith my own ears: the worst that they can say ofme is that I am a second brother and that I am aproper fellow of my hands; and those two things, Iconfess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.And the boy that I gave Falstaff: a' had him fromme Christian; and look, if the fat villain have nottransformed him ape.God save your grace!And yours, most noble Bardolph!Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must yoube blushing? wherefore blush you now? What amaidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such amatter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a redlattice, and I could discern no part of his facefrom the window: at last I spied his eyes, andmethought he had made two holes in the ale-wife'snew petticoat and so peeped through.Has not the boy profited?Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was deliveredof a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.A crown's worth of good interpretation: there 'tis,boy.O, that this good blossom could be kept fromcankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.An you do not make him hanged among you, thegallows shall have wrong.And how doth thy master, Bardolph?Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming totown: there's a letter for you.Delivered with good respect. And how doth themartlemas, your master?In bodily health, sir.Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; butthat moves not him: though that be sick, it diesnot.I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as mydog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.[Reads]  'John Falstaff, knight,'--every man mustknow that, as oft as he has occasion to namehimself: even like those that are kin to the king;for they never prick their finger but they say,'There's some of the king's blood spilt.' 'Howcomes that?' says he, that takes upon him not toconceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower'scap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch itfrom Japhet. But to the letter.[Reads]  'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son ofthe king, nearest his father, Harry Prince ofWales, greeting.' Why, this is a certificate.Peace![Reads]  'I will imitate the honourable Romans inbrevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,short-winded. 'I commend me to thee, I commendthee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar withPoins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that heswears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repentat idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as tosay, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with myfamiliars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,and SIR JOHN with all Europe.'My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But doyou use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and thespirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.Is your master here in London?Yea, my lord.Where sups he? doth the old boar feed in the old frank?At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.What company?Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.Sup any women with him?None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly andMistress Doll Tearsheet.What pagan may that be?A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the townbull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to yourmaster that I am yet come to town: there's foryour silence.I have no tongue, sir.And for mine, sir, I will govern it.Fare you well; go.This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.I warrant you, as common as the way between SaintAlban's and London.How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-nightin his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and waitupon him at his table as drawers.From a God to a bull? a heavy decension! it wasJove's case. From a prince to a prentice? a lowtransformation! that shall be mine; for in everything the purpose must weigh with the folly.Follow me, Ned.
