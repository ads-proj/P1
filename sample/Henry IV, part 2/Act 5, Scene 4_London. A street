No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I mightdie, that I might have thee hanged: thou hastdrawn my shoulder out of joint.The constables have delivered her over to me; andshe shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warranther: there hath been a man or two lately killed about her.Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I 'll tellthee what, thou damned tripe-visaged rascal, anthe child I now go with do miscarry, thou wertbetter thou hadst struck thy mother, thoupaper-faced villain.O the Lord, that Sir John were come! he would makethis a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God thefruit of her womb miscarry!If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again;you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both gowith me; for the man is dead that you and Pistolbeat amongst you.I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, Iwill have you as soundly swinged for this,--youblue-bottle rogue, you filthy famished correctioner,if you be not swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles.Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.O God, that right should thus overcome might!Well, of sufferance comes ease.Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.Ay, come, you starved blood-hound.Goodman death, goodman bones!Thou atomy, thou!Come, you thin thing; come you rascal.Very well.
