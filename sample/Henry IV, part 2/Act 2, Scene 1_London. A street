Master Fang, have you entered the action?It is entered.Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman? will a'stand to 't?Sirrah, where's Snare?O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.Here, here.Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him and all.It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me inmine own house, and that most beastly: in goodfaith, he cares not what mischief he does. If hisweapon be out: he will foin like any devil; he willspare neither man, woman, nor child.If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.No, nor I neither: I'll be at your elbow.An I but fist him once; an a' come but within my vice,--I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's aninfinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,hold him sure: good Master Snare, let him not'scape. A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner--savingyour manhoods--to buy a saddle; and he is indited todinner to the Lubber's-head in Lumbert street, toMaster Smooth's the silkman: I pray ye, since myexion is entered and my case so openly known to theworld, let him be brought in to his answer. Ahundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman tobear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, andhave been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbedoff, from this day to that day, that it is a shameto be thought on. There is no honesty in suchdealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and abeast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder hecomes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,with him. Do your offices, do your offices: MasterFang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.How now! whose mare's dead? what's the matter?Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph: cut me off thevillain's head: throw the quean in the channel.Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in thechannel. Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardlyrogue! Murder, murder! Ah, thou honeysucklevillain! wilt thou kill God's officers and theking's? Ah, thou honey-seed rogue! thou art ahoney-seed, a man-queller, and a woman-queller.Keep them off, Bardolph.A rescue! a rescue!Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wo't, wo'tthou? Thou wo't, wo't ta? do, do, thou rogue! do,thou hemp-seed!Away, you scullion! you rampallion! Youfustilarian! I'll tickle your catastrophe.Lord Chief-Justice	What is the matter? keep the peace here, ho!Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand to me.Lord Chief-Justice	How now, Sir John! what are you brawling here?Doth this become your place, your time and business?You should have been well on your way to York.Stand from him, fellow: wherefore hang'st upon him?O most worshipful lord, an't please your grace, I ama poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.Lord Chief-Justice	For what sum?It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all,all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;he hath put all my substance into that fat belly ofhis: but I will have some of it out again, or Iwill ride thee o' nights like the mare.I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I haveany vantage of ground to get up.Lord Chief-Justice	How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of goodtemper would endure this tempest of exclamation?Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to sorough a course to come by her own?What is the gross sum that I owe thee?Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and themoney too. Thou didst swear to me upon aparcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, uponWednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince brokethy head for liking his father to a singing-man ofWindsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I waswashing thy wound, to marry me and make me my ladythy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwifeKeech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call megossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess ofvinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby Itold thee they were ill for a green wound? Anddidst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,desire me to be no more so familiarity with suchpoor people; saying that ere long they should callme madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid mefetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thybook-oath: deny it, if thou canst.My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says upand down the town that the eldest son is like you:she hath been in good case, and the truth is,poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolishofficers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with yourmanner of wrenching the true cause the false way. Itis not a confident brow, nor the throng of wordsthat come with such more than impudent saucinessfrom you, can thrust me from a level consideration:you have, as it appears to me, practised upon theeasy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made herserve your uses both in purse and in person.Yea, in truth, my lord.Lord Chief-Justice	Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, andunpay the villany you have done her: the one youmay do with sterling money, and the other withcurrent repentance.My lord, I will not undergo this sneap withoutreply. You call honourable boldness impudentsauciness: if a man will make courtesy and saynothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humbleduty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I sayto you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs.Lord Chief-Justice	You speak as having power to do wrong: but answerin the effect of your reputation, and satisfy thispoor woman.Come hither, hostess.Lord Chief-Justice	Now, Master Gower, what news?The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of WalesAre near at hand: the rest the paper tells.As I am a gentleman.Faith, you said so before.As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of it.By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fainto pawn both my plate and the tapestry of mydining-chambers.Glasses, glasses is the only drinking: and for thywalls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story ofthe Prodigal, or the German hunting in water-work,is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and thesefly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thoucanst. Come, an 'twere not for thy humours, there'snot a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face,and draw the action. Come, thou must not be inthis humour with me; dost not know me? come, come, Iknow thou wast set on to this.Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles: i'faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me,la!Let it alone; I'll make other shift: you'll be afool still.Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown. Ihope you'll come to supper. You'll pay me all together?Will I live?Go, with her, with her; hook on, hook on.Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?No more words; let's have her.Lord Chief-Justice	I have heard better news.What's the news, my lord?Lord Chief-Justice	Where lay the king last night?At Basingstoke, my lord.I hope, my lord, all's well: what is the news, my lord?Lord Chief-Justice	Come all his forces back?No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster,Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.Comes the king back from Wales, my noble lord?Lord Chief-Justice	You shall have letters of me presently:Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.My lord!Lord Chief-Justice	What's the matter?Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank you,good Sir John.Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are totake soldiers up in counties as you go.Will you sup with me, Master Gower?Lord Chief-Justice	What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a foolthat taught them me. This is the right fencinggrace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.Lord Chief-Justice	Now the Lord lighten thee! thou art a great fool.
