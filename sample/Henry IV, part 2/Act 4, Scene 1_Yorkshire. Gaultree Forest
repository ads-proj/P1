What is this forest call'd?'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your grace.Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forthTo know the numbers of our enemies.We have sent forth already.'Tis well done.My friends and brethren in these great affairs,I must acquaint you that I have receivedNew-dated letters from Northumberland;Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:Here doth he wish his person, with such powersAs might hold sortance with his quality,The which he could not levy; whereuponHe is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayersThat your attempts may overlive the hazardAnd fearful melting of their opposite.Thus do the hopes we have in him touch groundAnd dash themselves to pieces.Now, what news?West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,In goodly form comes on the enemy;And, by the ground they hide, I judge their numberUpon or near the rate of thirty thousand.The just proportion that we gave them outLet us sway on and face them in the field.What well-appointed leader fronts us here?I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.Health and fair greeting from our general,The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:What doth concern your coming?Then, my lord,Unto your grace do I in chief addressThe substance of my speech. If that rebellionCame like itself, in base and abject routs,Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,And countenanced by boys and beggary,I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,In his true, native and most proper shape,You, reverend father, and these noble lordsHad not been here, to dress the ugly formOf base and bloody insurrectionWith your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,Whose white investments figure innocence,The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,Wherefore do you so ill translate ourselfOut of the speech of peace that bears such grace,Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,Your pens to lances and your tongue divineTo a trumpet and a point of war?Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,And with our surfeiting and wanton hoursHave brought ourselves into a burning fever,And we must bleed for it; of which diseaseOur late king, Richard, being infected, died.But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,I take not on me here as a physician,Nor do I as an enemy to peaceTroop in the throngs of military men;But rather show awhile like fearful war,To diet rank minds sick of happinessAnd purge the obstructions which begin to stopOur very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.I have in equal balance justly weigh'dWhat wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,And find our griefs heavier than our offences.We see which way the stream of time doth run,And are enforced from our most quiet thereBy the rough torrent of occasion;And have the summary of all our griefs,When time shall serve, to show in articles;Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,And might by no suit gain our audience:When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,We are denied access unto his personEven by those men that most have done us wrong.The dangers of the days but newly gone,Whose memory is written on the earthWith yet appearing blood, and the examplesOf every minute's instance, present now,Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,Not to break peace or any branch of it,But to establish here a peace indeed,Concurring both in name and quality.When ever yet was your appeal denied?Wherein have you been galled by the king?What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,That you should seal this lawless bloody bookOf forged rebellion with a seal divineAnd consecrate commotion's bitter edge?My brother general, the commonwealth,To brother born an household cruelty,I make my quarrel in particular.There is no need of any such redress;Or if there were, it not belongs to you.Why not to him in part, and to us allThat feel the bruises of the days before,And suffer the condition of these timesTo lay a heavy and unequal handUpon our honours?O, my good Lord Mowbray,Construe the times to their necessities,And you shall say indeed, it is the time,And not the king, that doth you injuries.Yet for your part, it not appears to meEither from the king or in the present timeThat you should have an inch of any groundTo build a grief on: were you not restoredTo all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,Your noble and right well remember'd father's?What thing, in honour, had my father lost,That need to be revived and breathed in me?The king that loved him, as the state stood then,Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,Being mounted and both roused in their seats,Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steelAnd the loud trumpet blowing them together,Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'dMy father from the breast of Bolingbroke,O when the king did throw his warder down,His own life hung upon the staff he threw;Then threw he down himself and all their livesThat by indictment and by dint of swordHave since miscarried under Bolingbroke.You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.The Earl of Hereford was reputed thenIn England the most valiant gentlemen:Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?But if your father had been victor there,He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:For all the country in a general voiceCried hate upon him; and all their prayers and loveWere set on Hereford, whom they doted onAnd bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.But this is mere digression from my purpose.Here come I from our princely generalTo know your griefs; to tell you from his graceThat he will give you audience; and whereinIt shall appear that your demands are just,You shall enjoy them, every thing set offThat might so much as think you enemies.But he hath forced us to compel this offer;And it proceeds from policy, not love.Mowbray, you overween to take it so;This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:For, lo! within a ken our army lies,Upon mine honour, all too confidentTo give admittance to a thought of fear.Our battle is more full of names than yours,Our men more perfect in the use of arms,Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;Then reason will our heart should be as goodSay you not then our offer is compell'd.Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.That argues but the shame of your offence:A rotten case abides no handling.Hath the Prince John a full commission,In very ample virtue of his father,To hear and absolutely to determineOf what conditions we shall stand upon?That is intended in the general's name:I muse you make so slight a question.Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,For this contains our general grievances:Each several article herein redress'd,All members of our cause, both here and hence,That are insinew'd to this action,Acquitted by a true substantial formAnd present execution of our willsTo us and to our purposes confined,We come within our awful banks againAnd knit our powers to the arm of peace.This will I show the general. Please you, lords,In sight of both our battles we may meet;And either end in peace, which God so frame!Or to the place of difference call the swordsWhich must decide it.My lord, we will do so.There is a thing within my bosom tells meThat no conditions of our peace can stand.Fear you not that: if we can make our peaceUpon such large terms and so absoluteAs our conditions shall consist upon,Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.Yea, but our valuation shall be suchThat every slight and false-derived cause,Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reasonShall to the king taste of this action;That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,We shall be winnow'd with so rough a windThat even our corn shall seem as light as chaffAnd good from bad find no partition.No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is wearyOf dainty and such picking grievances:For he hath found to end one doubt by deathRevives two greater in the heirs of life,And therefore will he wipe his tables cleanAnd keep no tell-tale to his memoryThat may repeat and history his lossTo new remembrance; for full well he knowsHe cannot so precisely weed this landAs his misdoubts present occasion:His foes are so enrooted with his friendsThat, plucking to unfix an enemy,He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:So that this land, like an offensive wifeThat hath enraged him on to offer strokes,As he is striking, holds his infant upAnd hangs resolved correction in the armThat was uprear'd to execution.Besides, the king hath wasted all his rodsOn late offenders, that he now doth lackThe very instruments of chastisement:So that his power, like to a fangless lion,May offer, but not hold.'Tis very true:And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,If we do now make our atonement well,Our peace will, like a broken limb united,Grow stronger for the breaking.Be it so.Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordshipTo meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.
