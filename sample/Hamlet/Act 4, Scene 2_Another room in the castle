Safely stowed.[Within]  Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!What noise? who calls on Hamlet?O, here they come.What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thenceAnd bear it to the chapel.Do not believe it.Believe what?That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! whatreplication should be made by the son of a king?Take you me for a sponge, my lord?Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, hisrewards, his authorities. But such officers do theking best service in the end: he keeps them, likean ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, tobe last swallowed: when he needs what you havegleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, youshall be dry again.I understand you not, my lord.I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in afoolish ear.My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and gowith us to the king.The body is with the king, but the king is not withthe body. The king is a thing--A thing, my lord!Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
