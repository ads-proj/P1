Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;This is the fool that lent out money gratis:Gaoler, look to him.Hear me yet, good Shylock.I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fondTo come abroad with him at his request.I pray thee, hear me speak.I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yieldTo Christian intercessors. Follow not;I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.It is the most impenetrable curThat ever kept with men.Let him alone:I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.He seeks my life; his reason well I know:I oft deliver'd from his forfeituresMany that have at times made moan to me;Therefore he hates me.I am sure the dukeWill never grant this forfeiture to hold.The duke cannot deny the course of law:For the commodity that strangers haveWith us in Venice, if it be denied,Will much impeach the justice of his state;Since that the trade and profit of the cityConsisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:These griefs and losses have so bated me,That I shall hardly spare a pound of fleshTo-morrow to my bloody creditor.Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio comeTo see me pay his debt, and then I care not!
