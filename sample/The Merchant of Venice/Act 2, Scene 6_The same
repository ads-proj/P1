This is the pent-house under which LorenzoDesired us to make stand.His hour is almost past.And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,For lovers ever run before the clock.O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons flyTo seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wontTo keep obliged faith unforfeited!That ever holds: who riseth from a feastWith that keen appetite that he sits down?Where is the horse that doth untread againHis tedious measures with the unbated fireThat he did pace them first? All things that are,Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.How like a younker or a prodigalThe scarfed bark puts from her native bay,Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!How like the prodigal doth she return,With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.Lorenzo, and thy love.Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,For who love I so much? And now who knowsBut you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,For I am much ashamed of my exchange:But love is blind and lovers cannot seeThe pretty follies that themselves commit;For if they could, Cupid himself would blushTo see me thus transformed to a boy.Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.What, must I hold a candle to my shames?They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;And I should be obscured.So are you, sweet,Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.But come at once;For the close night doth play the runaway,And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.I will make fast the doors, and gild myselfWith some more ducats, and be with you straight.Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.Beshrew me but I love her heartily;For she is wise, if I can judge of her,And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,And true she is, as she hath proved herself,And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,Shall she be placed in my constant soul.What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.Who's there?Signior Antonio!Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.No masque to-night: the wind is come about;Bassanio presently will go aboard:I have sent twenty out to seek for you.I am glad on't: I desire no more delightThan to be under sail and gone to-night.
