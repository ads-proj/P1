I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou seeLorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:Give him this letter; do it secretly;And so farewell: I would not have my fatherSee me in talk with thee.Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautifulpagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not playthe knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,adieu: these foolish drops do something drown mymanly spirit: adieu.Farewell, good Launcelot.Alack, what heinous sin is it in meTo be ashamed to be my father's child!But though I am a daughter to his blood,I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,Become a Christian and thy loving wife.
