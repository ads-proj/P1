Three thousand ducats; well.Ay, sir, for three months.For three months; well.For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.Antonio shall become bound; well.May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall Iknow your answer?Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.Your answer to that.Antonio is a good man.Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is agood man is to have you understand me that he issufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: hehath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to theIndies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, hehath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, andother ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But shipsare but boards, sailors but men: there be land-ratsand water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, Imean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I maytake his bond.Be assured you may.I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?If it please you to dine with us.Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation whichyour prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. Iwill buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,walk with you, and so following, but I will not eatwith you, drink with you, nor pray with you. Whatnews on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?This is Signior Antonio.[Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!I hate him for he is a Christian,But more for that in low simplicityHe lends out money gratis and brings downThe rate of usance here with us in Venice.If I can catch him once upon the hip,I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,Even there where merchants most do congregate,On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,If I forgive him!Shylock, do you hear?I am debating of my present store,And, by the near guess of my memory,I cannot instantly raise up the grossOf full three thousand ducats. What of that?Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,Will furnish me. But soft! how many monthsDo you desire?Rest you fair, good signior;Your worship was the last man in our mouths.Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrowBy taking nor by giving of excess,Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'dHow much ye would?Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.And for three months.I had forgot; three months; you told me so.Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;Methought you said you neither lend nor borrowUpon advantage.I do never use it.When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--This Jacob from our holy Abram was,As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,The third possessor; ay, he was the third--And what of him? did he take interest?No, not take interest, not, as you would say,Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.When Laban and himself were compromisedThat all the eanlings which were streak'd and piedShould fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,In the end of autumn turned to the rams,And, when the work of generation wasBetween these woolly breeders in the act,The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,And, in the doing of the deed of kind,He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,Who then conceiving did in eaning timeFall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;A thing not in his power to bring to pass,But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.Was this inserted to make interest good?Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:But note me, signior.Mark you this, Bassanio,The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.An evil soul producing holy witnessIs like a villain with a smiling cheek,A goodly apple rotten at the heart:O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?Signior Antonio, many a time and oftIn the Rialto you have rated meAbout my moneys and my usances:Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,And all for use of that which is mine own.Well then, it now appears you need my help:Go to, then; you come to me, and you say'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;You, that did void your rheum upon my beardAnd foot me as you spurn a stranger curOver your threshold: moneys is your suitWhat should I say to you? Should I not say'Hath a dog money? is it possibleA cur can lend three thousand ducats?' OrShall I bend low and in a bondman's key,With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;You spurn'd me such a day; another timeYou call'd me dog; and for these courtesiesI'll lend you thus much moneys'?I am as like to call thee so again,To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.If thou wilt lend this money, lend it notAs to thy friends; for when did friendship takeA breed for barren metal of his friend?But lend it rather to thine enemy,Who, if he break, thou mayst with better faceExact the penalty.Why, look you, how you storm!I would be friends with you and have your love,Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,Supply your present wants and take no doitOf usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:This is kind I offer.This were kindness.This kindness will I show.Go with me to a notary, seal me thereYour single bond; and, in a merry sport,If you repay me not on such a day,In such a place, such sum or sums as areExpress'd in the condition, let the forfeitBe nominated for an equal poundOf your fair flesh, to be cut off and takenIn what part of your body pleaseth me.Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bondAnd say there is much kindness in the Jew.You shall not seal to such a bond for me:I'll rather dwell in my necessity.Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:Within these two months, that's a month beforeThis bond expires, I do expect returnOf thrice three times the value of this bond.O father Abram, what these Christians are,Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspectThe thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;If he should break his day, what should I gainBy the exaction of the forfeiture?A pound of man's flesh taken from a manIs not so estimable, profitable neither,As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;Give him direction for this merry bond,And I will go and purse the ducats straight,See to my house, left in the fearful guardOf an unthrifty knave, and presentlyI will be with you.Hie thee, gentle Jew.The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.Come on: in this there can be no dismay;My ships come home a month before the day.
