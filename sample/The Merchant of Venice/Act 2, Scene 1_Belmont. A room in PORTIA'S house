Mislike me not for my complexion,The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.Bring me the fairest creature northward born,Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,And let us make incision for your love,To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mineHath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swearThe best-regarded virgins of our climeHave loved it too: I would not change this hue,Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.In terms of choice I am not solely ledBy nice direction of a maiden's eyes;Besides, the lottery of my destinyBars me the right of voluntary choosing:But if my father had not scanted meAnd hedged me by his wit, to yield myselfHis wife who wins me by that means I told you,Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fairAs any comer I have look'd on yetFor my affection.Even for that I thank you:Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the casketsTo try my fortune. By this scimitarThat slew the Sophy and a Persian princeThat won three fields of Sultan Solyman,I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!If Hercules and Lichas play at diceWhich is the better man, the greater throwMay turn by fortune from the weaker hand:So is Alcides beaten by his page;And so may I, blind fortune leading me,Miss that which one unworthier may attain,And die with grieving.You must take your chance,And either not attempt to choose at allOr swear before you choose, if you choose wrongNever to speak to lady afterwardIn way of marriage: therefore be advised.Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.First, forward to the temple: after dinnerYour hazard shall be made.Good fortune then!To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
