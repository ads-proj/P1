I pray you, tarry: pause a day or twoBefore you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.There's something tells me, but it is not love,I would not lose you; and you know yourself,Hate counsels not in such a quality.But lest you should not understand me well,--And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--I would detain you here some month or twoBefore you venture for me. I could teach youHow to choose right, but I am then forsworn;So will I never be: so may you miss me;But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;One half of me is yours, the other half yours,Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,And so all yours. O, these naughty timesPut bars between the owners and their rights!And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,To eke it and to draw it out in length,To stay you from election.Let me chooseFor as I am, I live upon the rack.Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confessWhat treason there is mingled with your love.None but that ugly treason of mistrust,Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:There may as well be amity and life'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,Where men enforced do speak anything.Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.Well then, confess and live.'Confess' and 'love'Had been the very sum of my confession:O happy torment, when my torturerDoth teach me answers for deliverance!But let me to my fortune and the caskets.Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:If you do love me, you will find me out.Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.Let music sound while he doth make his choice;Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,Fading in music: that the comparisonMay stand more proper, my eye shall be the streamAnd watery death-bed for him. He may win;And what is music then? Then music isEven as the flourish when true subjects bowTo a new-crowned monarch: such it isAs are those dulcet sounds in break of dayThat creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,With no less presence, but with much more love,Than young Alcides, when he did redeemThe virgin tribute paid by howling TroyTo the sea-monster: I stand for sacrificeThe rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,With bleared visages, come forth to viewThe issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismayI view the fight than thou that makest the fray.SONG.Tell me where is fancy bred,Or in the heart, or in the head?How begot, how nourished?Reply, reply.It is engender'd in the eyes,With gazing fed; and fancy diesIn the cradle where it lies.Let us all ring fancy's knellI'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.Ding, dong, bell.So may the outward shows be least themselves:The world is still deceived with ornament.In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,Obscures the show of evil? In religion,What damned error, but some sober browWill bless it and approve it with a text,Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?There is no vice so simple but assumesSome mark of virtue on his outward parts:How many cowards, whose hearts are all as falseAs stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chinsThe beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;And these assume but valour's excrementTo render them redoubted! Look on beauty,And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;Which therein works a miracle in nature,Making them lightest that wear most of it:So are those crisped snaky golden locksWhich make such wanton gambols with the wind,Upon supposed fairness, often knownTo be the dowry of a second head,The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.Thus ornament is but the guiled shoreTo a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarfVeiling an Indian beauty; in a word,The seeming truth which cunning times put onTo entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;And here choose I; joy be the consequence![Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,For fear I surfeit.What find I here?Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-godHath come so near creation? Move these eyes?Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a barShould sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairsThe painter plays the spider and hath wovenA golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--How could he see to do them? having made one,Methinks it should have power to steal both hisAnd leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how farThe substance of my praise doth wrong this shadowIn underprizing it, so far this shadowDoth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,The continent and summary of my fortune.You that choose not by the view,Chance as fair and choose as true!Since this fortune falls to you,Be content and seek no new,If you be well pleased with thisAnd hold your fortune for your bliss,Turn you where your lady isAnd claim her with a loving kiss.A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;I come by note, to give and to receive.Like one of two contending in a prize,That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,Hearing applause and universal shout,Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubtWhether these pearls of praise be his or no;So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;As doubtful whether what I see be true,Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,Such as I am: though for myself aloneI would not be ambitious in my wish,To wish myself much better; yet, for youI would be trebled twenty times myself;A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;That only to stand high in your account,I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,Exceed account; but the full sum of meIs sum of something, which, to term in gross,Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;Happy in this, she is not yet so oldBut she may learn; happier than this,She is not bred so dull but she can learn;Happiest of all is that her gentle spiritCommits itself to yours to be directed,As from her lord, her governor, her king.Myself and what is mine to you and yoursIs now converted: but now I was the lordOf this fair mansion, master of my servants,Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,This house, these servants and this same myselfAre yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;Which when you part from, lose, or give away,Let it presage the ruin of your loveAnd be my vantage to exclaim on you.Madam, you have bereft me of all words,Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;And there is such confusion in my powers,As after some oration fairly spokeBy a beloved prince, there doth appearAmong the buzzing pleased multitude;Where every something, being blent together,Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,Express'd and not express'd. But when this ringParts from this finger, then parts life from hence:O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!My lord and lady, it is now our time,That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,I wish you all the joy that you can wish;For I am sure you can wish none from me:And when your honours mean to solemnizeThe bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,Even at that time I may be married too.With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.I thank your lordship, you have got me one.My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;You loved, I loved for intermission.No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.Your fortune stood upon the casket there,And so did mine too, as the matter falls;For wooing here until I sweat again,And sweating until my very roof was dryWith oaths of love, at last, if promise last,I got a promise of this fair one hereTo have her love, provided that your fortuneAchieved her mistress.Is this true, Nerissa?Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?Yes, faith, my lord.Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.What, and stake down?No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,and my old Venetian friend Salerio?Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;If that the youth of my new interest hereHave power to bid you welcome. By your leave,I bid my very friends and countrymen,Sweet Portia, welcome.So do I, my lord:They are entirely welcome.I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,My purpose was not to have seen you here;But meeting with Salerio by the way,He did entreat me, past all saying nay,To come with him along.I did, my lord;And I have reason for it. Signior AntonioCommends him to you.Ere I ope his letter,I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;Nor well, unless in mind: his letter thereWill show you his estate.Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?I know he will be glad of our success;We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the worldCould turn so much the constitutionOf any constant man. What, worse and worse!With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,And I must freely have the half of anythingThat this same paper brings you.O sweet Portia,Here are a few of the unpleasant'st wordsThat ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,When I did first impart my love to you,I freely told you, all the wealth I hadRan in my veins, I was a gentleman;And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,Rating myself at nothing, you shall seeHow much I was a braggart. When I told youMy state was nothing, I should then have told youThat I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,I have engaged myself to a dear friend,Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;The paper as the body of my friend,And every word in it a gaping wound,Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,From Lisbon, Barbary and India?And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touchOf merchant-marring rocks?Not one, my lord.Besides, it should appear, that if he hadThe present money to discharge the Jew,He would not take it. Never did I knowA creature, that did bear the shape of man,So keen and greedy to confound a man:He plies the duke at morning and at night,And doth impeach the freedom of the state,If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,The duke himself, and the magnificoesOf greatest port, have all persuaded with him;But none can drive him from the envious pleaOf forfeiture, of justice and his bond.When I was with him I have heard him swearTo Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,That he would rather have Antonio's fleshThan twenty times the value of the sumThat he did owe him: and I know, my lord,If law, authority and power deny not,It will go hard with poor Antonio.Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,The best-condition'd and unwearied spiritIn doing courtesies, and one in whomThe ancient Roman honour more appearsThan any that draws breath in Italy.What sum owes he the Jew?For me three thousand ducats.What, no more?Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;Double six thousand, and then treble that,Before a friend of this descriptionShall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.First go with me to church and call me wife,And then away to Venice to your friend;For never shall you lie by Portia's sideWith an unquiet soul. You shall have goldTo pay the petty debt twenty times over:When it is paid, bring your true friend along.My maid Nerissa and myself meantimeWill live as maids and widows. Come, away!For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.But let me hear the letter of your friend.[Reads]  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have allmiscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate isvery low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and sincein paying it, it is impossible I should live, alldebts are cleared between you and I, if I might butsee you at my death. Notwithstanding, use yourpleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,let not my letter.O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!Since I have your good leave to go away,I will make haste: but, till I come again,No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.
