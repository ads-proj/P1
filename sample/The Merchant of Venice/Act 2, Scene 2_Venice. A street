Certainly my conscience will serve me to run fromthis Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow andtempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, goodLauncelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good LauncelotGobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. Myconscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honestLauncelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thyheels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids mepack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says thefiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wiselyto me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honestman's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,indeed, my father did something smack, somethinggrow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my consciencesays 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says thefiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by myconscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, torun away from the Jew, I should be ruled by thefiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devilhimself. Certainly the Jew is the very devilincarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience isbut a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counselme to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the morefriendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels areat your command; I will run.Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the wayto master Jew's?[Aside]  O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,knows me not: I will try confusions with him.Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the wayto master Jew's?Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, atthe very next turning, turn of no hand, but turndown indirectly to the Jew's house.By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Canyou tell me whether one Launcelot,that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?Talk you of young Master Launcelot?Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk youof young Master Launcelot?No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor manand, God be thanked, well to live.Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk ofyoung Master Launcelot.Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,talk you of young Master Launcelot?Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of MasterLauncelot, father; for the young gentleman,according to Fates and Destinies and such oddsayings, the Sisters Three and such branches oflearning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would sayin plain terms, gone to heaven.Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of myage, my very prop.Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff ora prop? Do you know me, father?Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest hissoul, alive or dead?Do you not know me, father?Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail ofthe knowing me: it is a wise father that knows hisown child. Well, old man, I will tell you news ofyour son: give me your blessing: truth will cometo light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's sonmay, but at the length truth will out.Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are notLauncelot, my boy.Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, butgive me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boythat was, your son that is, your child that shallbe.I cannot think you are my son.I know not what I shall think of that: but I amLauncelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery yourwife is my mother.Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thoube Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thougot! thou hast got more hair on thy chin thanDobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail growsbackward: I am sure he had more hair of his tailthan I have of my face when I last saw him.Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thymaster agree? I have brought him a present. How'gree you now?Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have setup my rest to run away, so I will not rest till Ihave run some ground. My master's a very Jew: givehim a present! give him a halter: I am famished inhis service; you may tell every finger I have withmy ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give meyour present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, Iwill run as far as God has any ground. O rarefortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for Iam a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supperbe ready at the farthest by five of the clock. Seethese letters delivered; put the liveries to making,and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.To him, father.God bless your worship!Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; thatwould, sir, as my father shall specify--He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,and have a desire, as my father shall specify--His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,are scarce cater-cousins--To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, havingdone me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, Ihope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow uponyour worship, and my suit is--In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, asyour worship shall know by this honest old man; and,though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.One speak for both. What would you?Serve you, sir.That is the very defect of the matter, sir.I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,And hath preferr'd thee, if it be prefermentTo leave a rich Jew's service, to becomeThe follower of so poor a gentleman.The old proverb is very well parted between mymaster Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace ofGod, sir, and he hath enough.Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.Take leave of thy old master and inquireMy lodging out. Give him a liveryMore guarded than his fellows': see it done.Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I havene'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man inItaly have a fairer table which doth offer to swearupon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifleof wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! elevenwidows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for oneman: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to bein peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be awoman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,Return in haste, for I do feast to-nightMy best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.My best endeavours shall be done herein.Where is your master?Yonder, sir, he walks.Signior Bassanio!Gratiano!I have a suit to you.You have obtain'd it.You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;Parts that become thee happily enoughAnd in such eyes as ours appear not faults;But where thou art not known, why, there they showSomething too liberal. Pray thee, take painTo allay with some cold drops of modestyThy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behaviorI be misconstrued in the place I go to,And lose my hopes.Signior Bassanio, hear me:If I do not put on a sober habit,Talk with respect and swear but now and then,Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyesThus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'Use all the observance of civility,Like one well studied in a sad ostentTo please his grandam, never trust me more.Well, we shall see your bearing.Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge meBy what we do to-night.No, that were pity:I would entreat you rather to put onYour boldest suit of mirth, for we have friendsThat purpose merriment. But fare you well:I have some business.And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:But we will visit you at supper-time.
