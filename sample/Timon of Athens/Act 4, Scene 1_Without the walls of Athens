Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,And minister in their steads! to general filthsConvert o' the instant, green virginity,Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;Rather than render back, out with your knives,And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,Decline to your confounding contraries,And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,Your potent and infectious fevers heapOn Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,Cripple our senators, that their limbs may haltAs lamely as their manners. Lust and libertyCreep in the minds and marrows of our youth,That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their cropBe general leprosy! Breath infect breath,at their society, as their friendship, maymerely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,But nakedness, thou detestable town!Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!Timon will to the woods; where he shall findThe unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--The Athenians both within and out that wall!And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may growTo the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.
