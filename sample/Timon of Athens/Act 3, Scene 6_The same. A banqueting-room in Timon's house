The good time of day to you, sir.I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lorddid but try us this other day.Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when weencountered: I hope it is not so low with him ashe made it seem in the trial of his several friends.It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.I should think so: he hath sent me an earnestinviting, which many my near occasions did urge meto put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, andI must needs appear.In like manner was I in debt to my importunatebusiness, but he would not hear my excuse. I amsorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that myprovision was out.I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how allthings go.Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed ofyou?A thousand pieces.A thousand pieces!What of you?He sent to me, sir,--Here he comes.With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.The swallow follows not summer more willing than weyour lordship.[Aside]  Nor more willingly leaves winter; suchsummer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will notrecompense this long stay: feast your ears with themusic awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' thetrumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordshipthat I returned you an empty messenger.O, sir, let it not trouble you.My noble lord,--Ah, my good friend, what cheer?My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,I was so unfortunate a beggar.Think not on 't, sir.If you had sent but two hours before,--Let it not cumber your better remembrance.Come, bring in all together.All covered dishes!Royal cheer, I warrant you.Doubt not that, if money and the season can yieldit.How do you? What's the news?Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?Alcibiades banished!'Tis so, be sure of it.How! how!I pray you, upon what?My worthy friends, will you draw near?I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.This is the old man still.Will 't hold? will 't hold?It does: but time will--and so--I do conceive.Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would tothe lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in allplaces alike. Make not a city feast of it, to letthe meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.You great benefactors, sprinkle our society withthankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselvespraised: but reserve still to give, lest yourdeities be despised. Lend to each man enough, thatone need not lend to another; for, were yourgodheads to borrow of men, men would forsake thegods. Make the meat be beloved more than the manthat gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be withouta score of villains: if there sit twelve women atthe table, let a dozen of them be--as they are. Therest of your fees, O gods--the senators of Athens,together with the common lag of people--what isamiss in them, you gods, make suitable fordestruction. For these my present friends, as theyare to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and tonothing are they welcome.Uncover, dogs, and lap.What does his lordship mean?I know not.May you a better feast never behold,You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm waterIs your perfection. This is Timon's last;Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,Washes it off, and sprinkles in your facesYour reeking villany.Live loathed and long,Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!Of man and beast the infinite maladyCrust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated beOf Timon man and all humanity!How now, my lords!Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?Push! did you see my cap?I have lost my gown.He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he hasbeat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?Did you see my cap?Here 'tis.Here lies my gown.Let's make no stay.Lord Timon's mad.I feel 't upon my bones.One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.
