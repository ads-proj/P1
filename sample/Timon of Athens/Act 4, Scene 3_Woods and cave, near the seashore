O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earthRotten humidity; below thy sister's orbInfect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,Whose procreation, residence, and birth,Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,But by contempt of nature.Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,The beggar native honour.It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,In purity of manhood stand upright,And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,So are they all; for every grise of fortuneIs smooth'd by that below: the learned pateDucks to the golden fool: all is oblique;There's nothing level in our cursed natures,But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'dAll feasts, societies, and throngs of men!His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palateWith thy most operant poison! What is here?Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, thisWill lug your priests and servants from your sides,Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:This yellow slaveWill knit and break religions, bless the accursed,Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thievesAnd give them title, knee and approbationWith senators on the bench: this is itThat makes the wappen'd widow wed again;She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous soresWould cast the gorge at, this embalms and spicesTo the April day again. Come, damned earth,Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st oddsAmong the route of nations, I will make theeDo thy right nature.Ha! a drum ? Thou'rt quick,But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.Nay, stay thou out for earnest.What art thou there? speak.A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,For showing me again the eyes of man!What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,That art thyself a man?I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,That I might love thee something.I know thee well;But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;Then what should war be? This fell whore of thineHath in her more destruction than thy sword,For all her cherubim look.Thy lips rot off!I will not kiss thee; then the rot returnsTo thine own lips again.How came the noble Timon to this change?As the moon does, by wanting light to give:But then renew I could not, like the moon;There were no suns to borrow of.Noble Timon,What friendship may I do thee?None, but toMaintain my opinion.What is it, Timon?Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thouwilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou arta man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, forthou art a man!I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.I see them now; then was a blessed time.As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.Is this the Athenian minion, whom the worldVoiced so regardfully?Art thou Timandra?Yes.Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.Make use of thy salt hours: season the slavesFor tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youthTo the tub-fast and the diet.Hang thee, monster!Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his witsAre drown'd and lost in his calamities.I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,The want whereof doth daily make revoltIn my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?I had rather be alone.Why, fare thee well:Here is some gold for thee.Keep it, I cannot eat it.When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,--Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?Ay, Timon, and have cause.The gods confound them all in thy conquest;And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!Why me, Timon?That, by killing of villains,Thou wast born to conquer my country.Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;Be as a planetary plague, when JoveWill o'er some high-viced city hang his poisonIn the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;It is her habit only that is honest,Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheekMake soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,Are not within the leaf of pity writ,But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;Think it a bastard, whom the oracleHath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thougivest me,Not all thy counsel.Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curseupon thee!Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swearInto strong shudders and to heavenly aguesThe immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths,I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;Let your close fire predominate his smoke,And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofsWith burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd,No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still;Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,A pox of wrinkles!Well, more gold: what then?Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold.Consumptions sowIn hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,That he may never more false title plead,Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,That scolds against the quality of flesh,And not believes himself: down with the nose,Down with it flat; take the bridge quite awayOf him that, his particular to foresee,Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pateruffians bald;And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the warDerive some pain from you: plague all;That your activity may defeat and quellThe source of all erection. There's more gold:Do you damn others, and let this damn you,And ditches grave you all!More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.I never did thee harm.Yes, thou spokest well of me.Call'st thou that harm?Men daily find it. Get thee away, and takeThy beagles with thee.We but offend him. Strike!That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,Engenders the black toad and adder blue,The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,With all the abhorred births below crisp heavenWhereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward faceHath to the marbled mansion all aboveNever presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughtsAnd morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,That from it all consideration slips!More man? plague, plague!I was directed hither: men reportThou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!This is in thee a nature but infected;A poor unmanly melancholy sprungFrom change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgotThat ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,By putting on the cunning of a carper.Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thriveBy that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcomeTo knaves and all approachers: 'tis most justThat thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'stThat the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,And skip where thou point'st out? will thecold brook,Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creaturesWhose naked natures live in an the spiteOf wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,To the conflicting elements exposed,Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;O, thou shalt find--A fool of thee: depart.I love thee better now than e'er I did.I hate thee worse.Why?Thou flatter'st misery.I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.Why dost thou seek me out?To vex thee.Always a villain's office or a fool's.Dost please thyself in't?Ay.What! a knave too?If thou didst put this sour-cold habit onTo castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thouDost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,Wert thou not beggar. Willing miseryOutlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:The one is filling still, never complete;The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,Hath a distracted and most wretched being,Worse than the worst, content.Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.Not by his breath that is more miserable.Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender armWith favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceededThe sweet degrees that this brief world affordsTo such as may the passive drugs of itFreely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyselfIn general riot; melted down thy youthIn different beds of lust; and never learn'dThe icy precepts of respect, but follow'dThe sugar'd game before thee. But myself,Who had the world as my confectionary,The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of menAt duty, more than I could frame employment,That numberless upon me stuck as leavesDo on the oak, hive with one winter's brushFell from their boughs and left me open, bareFor every storm that blows: I, to bear this,That never knew but better, is some burden:Thy nature did commence in sufferance, timeHath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuffTo some she beggar and compounded theePoor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.Art thou proud yet?Ay, that I am not thee.I, that I wasNo prodigal.I, that I am one now:Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.That the whole life of Athens were in this!Thus would I eat it.Here; I will mend thy feast.First mend my company, take away thyself.So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;if not, I would it were.What wouldst thou have to Athens?Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.Here is no use for gold.The best and truest;For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.Where liest o' nights, Timon?Under that's above me.Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eatit.Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!Where wouldst thou send it?To sauce thy dishes.The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but theextremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy giltand thy perfume, they mocked thee for too muchcuriosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but artdespised for the contrary. There's a medlar forthee, eat it.On what I hate I feed not.Dost hate a medlar?Ay, though it look like thee.An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldsthave loved thyself better now. What man didst thouever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thouever know beloved?Myself.I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep adog.What things in the world canst thou nearest compareto thy flatterers?Women nearest; but men, men are the thingsthemselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion ofmen, and remain a beast with the beasts?Ay, Timon.A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox wouldbeguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox wouldeat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion wouldsuspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused bythe ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness wouldtorment thee, and still thou livedst but as abreakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thygreediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldsthazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou theunicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee andmake thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wertthou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by theleopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german tothe lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors onthy life: all thy safety were remotion and thydefence absence. What beast couldst thou be, thatwere not subject to a beast? and what a beast artthou already, that seest not thy loss intransformation!If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thoumightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth ofAthens is become a forest of beasts.How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague ofcompany light upon thee! I will fear to catch itand give way: when I know not what else to do, I'llsee thee again.When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt bewelcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.All villains that do stand by thee are pure.There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.If I name thee.I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.I would my tongue could rot them off!Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!Choler does kill me that thou art alive;I swound to see thee.Would thou wouldst burst!Away,Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall loseA stone by thee.Beast!Slave!Toad!Rogue, rogue, rogue!I am sick of this false world, and will love noughtBut even the mere necessities upon 't.Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;Lie where the light foam the sea may beatThy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,That death in me at others' lives may laugh.O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defilerOf Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snowThat lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,That solder'st close impossibilities,And makest them kiss! that speak'st withevery tongue,To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtueSet them into confounding odds, that beastsMay have the world in empire!Would 'twere so!But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.Throng'd to!Ay.Thy back, I prithee.Live, and love thy misery.Long live so, and so die.I am quit.Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.Where should he have this gold? It is some poorfragment, some slender sort of his remainder: themere want of gold, and the falling-from of hisfriends, drove him into this melancholy.It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.Let us make the assay upon him: if he care notfor't, he will supply us easily; if he covetouslyreserve it, how shall's get it?True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.Is not this he?Where?'Tis his description.He; I know him.Save thee, Timon.Now, thieves?Soldiers, not thieves.Both too; and women's sons.We are not thieves, but men that much do want.Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bushLays her full mess before you. Want! why want?We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,As beasts and birds and fishes.Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you conThat you are thieves profess'd, that you work notIn holier shapes: for there is boundless theftIn limited professions. Rascal thieves,Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;His antidotes are poison, and he slaysMoe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.The sun's a thief, and with his great attractionRobs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolvesThe moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,That feeds and breeds by a composture stolenFrom general excrement: each thing's a thief:The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough powerHave uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,Break open shops; nothing can you steal,But thieves do lose it: steal no less for thisI give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.Has almost charmed me from my profession, bypersuading me to it.'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advisesus; not to have us thrive in our mystery.I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no timeso miserable but a man may be true.O you gods!Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?Full of decay and failing? O monumentAnd wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!What an alteration of honourHas desperate want made!What viler thing upon the earth than friendsWho can bring noblest minds to basest ends!How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,When man was wish'd to love his enemies!Grant I may ever love, and rather wooThose that would mischief me than those that do!Has caught me in his eye: I will presentMy honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!Away! what art thou?Have you forgot me, sir?Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.An honest poor servant of yours.Then I know thee not:I never had honest man about me, I; allI kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.The gods are witness,Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer griefFor his undone lord than mine eyes for you.What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then Ilove thee,Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'stFlinty mankind; whose eyes do never giveBut thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!I beg of you to know me, good my lord,To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lastsTo entertain me as your steward still.Had I a stewardSo true, so just, and now so comfortable?It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.Let me behold thy face. Surely, this manWas born of woman.Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaimOne honest man--mistake me not--but one;No more, I pray,--and he's a steward.How fain would I have hated all mankind!And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,I fell with curses.Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;For, by oppressing and betraying me,Thou mightst have sooner got another service:For many so arrive at second masters,Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,Expecting in return twenty for one?No, my most worthy master; in whose breastDoubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:Suspect still comes where an estate is least.That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,Care of your food and living; and, believe it,My most honour'd lord,For any benefit that points to me,Either in hope or present, I'ld exchangeFor this one wish, that you had power and wealthTo requite me, by making rich yourself.Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,Here, take: the gods out of my miseryHave sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogsWhat thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men likeblasted woods,And may diseases lick up their false bloods!And so farewell and thrive.O, let me stay,And comfort you, my master.If thou hatest curses,Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.
