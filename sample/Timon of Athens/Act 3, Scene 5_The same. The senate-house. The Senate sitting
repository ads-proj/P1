My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault'sBloody; 'tis necessary he should die:Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.Most true; the law shall bruise him.Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!Now, captain?I am an humble suitor to your virtues;For pity is the virtue of the law,And none but tyrants use it cruelly.It pleases time and fortune to lie heavyUpon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depthTo those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.He is a man, setting his fate aside,Of comely virtues:Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--An honour in him which buys out his fault--But with a noble fury and fair spirit,Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,He did oppose his foe:And with such sober and unnoted passionHe did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,As if he had but proved an argument.You undergo too strict a paradox,Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:Your words have took such pains as if they labour'dTo bring manslaughter into form and set quarrellingUpon the head of valour; which indeedIs valour misbegot and came into the worldWhen sects and factions were newly born:He's truly valiant that can wisely sufferThe worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongsHis outsides, to wear them like his raiment,carelessly,And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,To bring it into danger.If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!My lord,--You cannot make gross sins look clear:To revenge is no valour, but to bear.My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,If I speak like a captain.Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,And let the foes quietly cut their throats,Without repugnancy? If there beSuch valour in the bearing, what make weAbroad? why then, women are more valiantThat stay at home, if bearing carry it,And the ass more captain than the lion, the felonLoaden with irons wiser than the judge,If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,As you are great, be pitifully good:Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.To be in anger is impiety;But who is man that is not angry?Weigh but the crime with this.You breathe in vain.In vain! his service doneAt Lacedaemon and ByzantiumWere a sufficient briber for his life.What's that?I say, my lords, he has done fair service,And slain in fight many of your enemies:How full of valour did he bear himselfIn the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!He has made too much plenty with 'em;He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that oftenDrowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:If there were no foes, that were enoughTo overcome him: in that beastly furyHe has been known to commit outrages,And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,His days are foul and his drink dangerous.He dies.Hard fate! he might have died in war.My lords, if not for any parts in him--Though his right arm might purchase his own timeAnd be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:And, for I know your reverend ages loveSecurity, I'll pawn my victories, allMy honours to you, upon his good returns.If by this crime he owes the law his life,Why, let the war receive 't in valiant goreFor law is strict, and war is nothing more.We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,He forfeits his own blood that spills another.Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,I do beseech you, know me.How!Call me to your remembrances.What!I cannot think but your age has forgot me;It could not else be, I should prove so base,To sue, and be denied such common grace:My wounds ache at you.Do you dare our anger?'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;We banish thee for ever.Banish me!Banish your dotage; banish usury,That makes the senate ugly.If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swellour spirit,He shall be executed presently.Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may liveOnly in bone, that none may look on you!I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,While they have told their money and let outTheir coin upon large interest, I myselfRich only in large hurts. All those for this?Is this the balsam that the usuring senatePours into captains' wounds? Banishment!It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer upMy discontented troops, and lay for hearts.'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.
