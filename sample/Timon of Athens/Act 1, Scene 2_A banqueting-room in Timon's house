Most honour'd Timon,It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,And call him to long peace.He is gone happy, and has left me rich:Then, as in grateful virtue I am boundTo your free heart, I do return those talents,Doubled with thanks and service, from whose helpI derived liberty.O, by no means,Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:I gave it freely ever; and there's noneCan truly say he gives, if he receives:If our betters play at that game, we must not dareTo imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.A noble spirit!Nay, my lords,Ceremony was but devised at firstTo set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;But where there is true friendship, there needs none.Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunesThan my fortunes to me.My lord, we always have confess'd it.Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?O, Apemantus, you are welcome.No;You shall not make me welcome:I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour thereDoes not become a man: 'tis much to blame.They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yondman is ever angry. Go, let him have a table byhimself, for he does neither affect company, nor ishe fit for't, indeed.Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come toobserve; I give thee warning on't.I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;prithee, let my meat make thee silent.I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I shouldne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number ofmen eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves meto see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:Methinks they should invite them without knives;Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.There's much example for't; the fellow that sitsnext him now, parts bread with him, pledges thebreath of him in a divided draught, is the readiestman to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were ahuge man, I should fear to drink at meals;Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:Great men should drink with harness on their throats.My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.Let it flow this way, my good lord.Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tideswell. Those healths will make thee and thy statelook ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak tobe a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:This and my food are equals; there's no odds:Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.Apemantus' grace.Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;I pray for no man but myself:Grant I may never prove so fond,To trust man on his oath or bond;Or a harlot, for her weeping;Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:Or a keeper with my freedom;Or my friends, if I should need 'em.Amen. So fall to't:Rich men sin, and I eat root.Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.My heart is ever at your service, my lord.You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than adinner of friends.So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meatlike 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that youwould once use our hearts, whereby we might expresssome part of our zeals, we should think ourselvesfor ever perfect.O, no doubt, my good friends, but the godsthemselves have provided that I shall have much helpfrom you: how had you been my friends else? whyhave you that charitable title from thousands, didnot you chiefly belong to my heart? I have toldmore of you to myself than you can with modestyspeak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirmyou. O you gods, think I, what need we have anyfriends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? theywere the most needless creatures living, should wene'er have use for 'em, and would most resemblesweet instruments hung up in cases that keep theirsounds to themselves. Why, I have often wishedmyself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. Weare born to do benefits: and what better orproperer can we can our own than the riches of ourfriends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to haveso many, like brothers, commanding one another'sfortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: toforget their faults, I drink to you.Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.Joy had the like conception in our eyesAnd at that instant like a babe sprung up.Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.Much!What means that trump?How now?Please you, my lord, there are certainladies most desirous of admittance.Ladies! what are their wills?There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, whichbears that office, to signify their pleasures.I pray, let them be admitted.Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to allThat of his bounties taste! The five best sensesAcknowledge thee their patron; and come freelyTo gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;They only now come but to feast thine eyes.They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:Music, make their welcome!You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!They dance! they are mad women.Like madness is the glory of this life.As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;And spend our flatteries, to drink those menUpon whose age we void it up again,With poisonous spite and envy.Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their gravesOf their friends' gift?I should fear those that dance before me nowWould one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;Men shut their doors against a setting sun.You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,Which was not half so beautiful and kind;You have added worth unto 't and lustre,And entertain'd me with mine own device;I am to thank you for 't.My lord, you take us even at the best.'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not holdtaking, I doubt me.Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:Please you to dispose yourselves.Most thankfully, my lord.Flavius.My lord?The little casket bring me hither.Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!There is no crossing him in 's humour;Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could.'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.Where be our men?Here, my lord, in readiness.Our horses!O my friends,I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,I must entreat you, honour me so muchAs to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,Kind my lord.I am so far already in your gifts,--So are we all.My lord, there are certain nobles of the senateNewly alighted, and come to visit you.They are fairly welcome.I beseech your honour,Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:I prithee, let's be provided to show thementertainment.[Aside]  I scarce know how.May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,Out of his free love, hath presented to youFour milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.I shall accept them fairly; let the presentsBe worthily entertain'd.How now! what news?Please you, my lord, that honourablegentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your companyto-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honourtwo brace of greyhounds.I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,Not without fair reward.[Aside]                What will this come to?He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,And all out of an empty coffer:Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,To show him what a beggar his heart is,Being of no power to make his wishes good:His promises fly so beyond his stateThat what he speaks is all in debt; he owesFor every word: he is so kind that he nowPays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.Well, would I were gently put out of officeBefore I were forced out!Happier is he that has no friend to feedThan such that do e'en enemies exceed.I bleed inwardly for my lord.You do yourselvesMuch wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.With more than common thanks I will receive it.O, he's the very soul of bounty!And now I remember, my lord, you gaveGood words the other day of a bay courserI rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.You may take my word, my lord; I know, no manCan justly praise but what he does affect:I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.O, none so welcome.I take all and your several visitationsSo kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;It comes in charity to thee: for all thy livingIs 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hastLie in a pitch'd field.Ay, defiled land, my lord.We are so virtuously bound--And soAm I to you.So infinitely endear'd--All to you. Lights, more lights!The best of happiness,Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!Ready for his friends.What a coil's here!Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!I doubt whether their legs be worth the sumsThat are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would begood to thee.No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,there would be none left to rail upon thee, and thenthou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself inpaper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps andvain-glories?Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I amsworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and comewith better music.So:Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:I'll lock thy heaven from thee.O, that men's ears should beTo counsel deaf, but not to flattery!
