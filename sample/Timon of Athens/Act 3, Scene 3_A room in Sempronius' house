Must he needs trouble me in 't,--hum!--'boveall others?He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;And now Ventidius is wealthy too,Whom he redeem'd from prison: all theseOwe their estates unto him.My lord,They have all been touch'd and found base metal, forThey have au denied him.How! have they denied him?Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?And does he send to me? Three? hum!It shows but little love or judgment in him:Must I be his last refuge! His friends, likephysicians,Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,But his occasion might have woo'd me first;For, in my conscience, I was the first manThat e'er received gift from him:And does he think so backwardly of me now,That I'll requite its last? No:So it may prove an argument of laughterTo the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,And with their faint reply this answer join;Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. Thedevil knew not what he did when he made manpolitic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannotthink but, in the end, the villainies of man willset him clear. How fairly this lord strives toappear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,like those that under hot ardent zeal would setwhole realms on fire: Of such a nature is hispolitic love.This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wardsMany a bounteous year must be employ'dNow to guard sure their master.And this is all a liberal course allows;Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.
