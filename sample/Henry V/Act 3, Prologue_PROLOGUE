Thus with imagined wing our swift scene fliesIn motion of no less celerityThan that of thought. Suppose that you have seenThe well-appointed king at Hampton pierEmbark his royalty; and his brave fleetWith silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:Play with your fancies, and in them beholdUpon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;Hear the shrill whistle which doth order giveTo sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but thinkYou stand upon the ravage and beholdA city on the inconstant billows dancing;For so appears this fleet majestical,Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,And leave your England, as dead midnight still,Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'dWith one appearing hair, that will not followThese cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;Behold the ordnance on their carriages,With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;Tells Harry that the king doth offer himKatharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.The offer likes not: and the nimble gunnerWith linstock now the devilish cannon touches,And down goes all before them. Still be kind,And eke out our performance with your mind.
