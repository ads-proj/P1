Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?Not here in presence.Send for him, good uncle.Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,Before we hear him, of some things of weightThat task our thoughts, concerning us and France.God and his angels guard your sacred throneAnd make you long become it!Sure, we thank you.My learned lord, we pray you to proceedAnd justly and religiously unfoldWhy the law Salique that they have in FranceOr should, or should not, bar us in our claim:And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,Or nicely charge your understanding soulWith opening titles miscreate, whose rightSuits not in native colours with the truth;For God doth know how many now in healthShall drop their blood in approbationOf what your reverence shall incite us to.Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,How you awake our sleeping sword of war:We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;For never two such kingdoms did contendWithout much fall of blood; whose guiltless dropsAre every one a woe, a sore complaint'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swordsThat make such waste in brief mortality.Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;For we will hear, note and believe in heartThat what you speak is in your conscience wash'dAs pure as sin with baptism.Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,That owe yourselves, your lives and servicesTo this imperial throne. There is no barTo make against your highness' claim to FranceBut this, which they produce from Pharamond,'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:''No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'Which Salique land the French unjustly glozeTo be the realm of France, and PharamondThe founder of this law and female bar.Yet their own authors faithfully affirmThat the land Salique is in Germany,Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,There left behind and settled certain French;Who, holding in disdain the German womenFor some dishonest manners of their life,Establish'd then this law; to wit, no femaleShould be inheritrix in Salique land:Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.Then doth it well appear that Salique lawWas not devised for the realm of France:Nor did the French possess the Salique landUntil four hundred one and twenty yearsAfter defunction of King Pharamond,Idly supposed the founder of this law;Who died within the year of our redemptionFour hundred twenty-six; and Charles the GreatSubdued the Saxons, and did seat the FrenchBeyond the river Sala, in the yearEight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,Did, as heir general, being descendedOf Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,Make claim and title to the crown of France.Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crownOf Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir maleOf the true line and stock of Charles the Great,To find his title with some shows of truth,'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,Daughter to Charlemain, who was the sonTo Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the sonOf Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,Could not keep quiet in his conscience,Wearing the crown of France, till satisfiedThat fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:By the which marriage the line of Charles the GreatWas re-united to the crown of France.So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,King Lewis his satisfaction, all appearTo hold in right and title of the female:So do the kings of France unto this day;Howbeit they would hold up this Salique lawTo bar your highness claiming from the female,And rather choose to hide them in a netThan amply to imbar their crooked titlesUsurp'd from you and your progenitors.May I with right and conscience make this claim?The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!For in the book of Numbers is it writ,When the man dies, let the inheritanceDescend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;Look back into your mighty ancestors:Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,Making defeat on the full power of France,Whiles his most mighty father on a hillStood smiling to behold his lion's whelpForage in blood of French nobility.O noble English. that could entertainWith half their forces the full Pride of FranceAnd let another half stand laughing by,All out of work and cold for action!Awake remembrance of these valiant deadAnd with your puissant arm renew their feats:You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;The blood and courage that renowned themRuns in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liegeIs in the very May-morn of his youth,Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.Your brother kings and monarchs of the earthDo all expect that you should rouse yourself,As did the former lions of your blood.They know your grace hath cause and means and might;So hath your highness; never king of EnglandHad nobles richer and more loyal subjects,Whose hearts have left their bodies here in EnglandAnd lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,With blood and sword and fire to win your right;In aid whereof we of the spiritualtyWill raise your highness such a mighty sumAs never did the clergy at one timeBring in to any of your ancestors.We must not only arm to invade the French,But lay down our proportions to defendAgainst the Scot, who will make road upon usWith all advantages.They of those marches, gracious sovereign,Shall be a wall sufficient to defendOur inland from the pilfering borderers.We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,But fear the main intendment of the Scot,Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;For you shall read that my great-grandfatherNever went with his forces into FranceBut that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdomCame pouring, like the tide into a breach,With ample and brim fulness of his force,Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;That England, being empty of defence,Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;For hear her but exampled by herself:When all her chivalry hath been in FranceAnd she a mourning widow of her nobles,She hath herself not only well defendedBut taken and impounded as a strayThe King of Scots; whom she did send to France,To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kingsAnd make her chronicle as rich with praiseAs is the ooze and bottom of the seaWith sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.But there's a saying very old and true,'If that you will France win,Then with Scotland first begin:'For once the eagle England being in prey,To her unguarded nest the weasel ScotComes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,To tear and havoc more than she can eat.It follows then the cat must stay at home:Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,The advised head defends itself at home;For government, though high and low and lower,Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,Congreeing in a full and natural close,Like music.Therefore doth heaven divideThe state of man in divers functions,Setting endeavour in continual motion;To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,Creatures that by a rule in nature teachThe act of order to a peopled kingdom.They have a king and officers of sorts;Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,Which pillage they with merry march bring homeTo the tent-royal of their emperor;Who, busied in his majesty, surveysThe singing masons building roofs of gold,The civil citizens kneading up the honey,The poor mechanic porters crowding inTheir heavy burdens at his narrow gate,The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,Delivering o'er to executors paleThe lazy yawning drone. I this infer,That many things, having full referenceTo one consent, may work contrariously:As many arrows, loosed several ways,Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;As many lines close in the dial's centre;So may a thousand actions, once afoot.End in one purpose, and be all well borneWithout defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.Divide your happy England into four;Whereof take you one quarter into France,And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.If we, with thrice such powers left at home,Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,Let us be worried and our nation loseThe name of hardiness and policy.Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,And yours, the noble sinews of our power,France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,Ruling in large and ample emperyO'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,Tombless, with no remembrance over them:Either our history shall with full mouthSpeak freely of our acts, or else our grave,Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.Now are we well prepared to know the pleasureOf our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hearYour greeting is from him, not from the king.May't please your majesty to give us leaveFreely to render what we have in charge;Or shall we sparingly show you far offThe Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;Unto whose grace our passion is as subjectAs are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainnessTell us the Dauphin's mind.Thus, then, in few.Your highness, lately sending into France,Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the rightOf your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.In answer of which claim, the prince our masterSays that you savour too much of your youth,And bids you be advised there's nought in FranceThat can be with a nimble galliard won;You cannot revel into dukedoms there.He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,Desires you let the dukedoms that you claimHear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.What treasure, uncle?Tennis-balls, my liege.We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;His present and your pains we thank you for:When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,We will, in France, by God's grace, play a setShall strike his father's crown into the hazard.Tell him he hath made a match with such a wranglerThat all the courts of France will be disturb'dWith chaces. And we understand him well,How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,Not measuring what use we made of them.We never valued this poor seat of England;And therefore, living hence, did give ourselfTo barbarous licence; as 'tis ever commonThat men are merriest when they are from home.But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,Be like a king and show my sail of greatnessWhen I do rouse me in my throne of France:For that I have laid by my majestyAnd plodded like a man for working-days,But I will rise there with so full a gloryThat I will dazzle all the eyes of France,Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.And tell the pleasant prince this mock of hisHath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soulShall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeanceThat shall fly with them: for many a thousand widowsShall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;And some are yet ungotten and unbornThat shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.But this lies all within the will of God,To whom I do appeal; and in whose nameTell you the Dauphin I am coming on,To venge me as I may and to put forthMy rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.So get you hence in peace; and tell the DauphinHis jest will savour but of shallow wit,When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.This was a merry message.We hope to make the sender blush at it.Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hourThat may give furtherance to our expedition;For we have now no thought in us but France,Save those to God, that run before our business.Therefore let our proportions for these warsBe soon collected and all things thought uponThat may with reasonable swiftness addMore feathers to our wings; for, God before,We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.Therefore let every man now task his thought,That this fair action may on foot be brought.
