Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expresslyagainst the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece ofknavery, mark you now, as can be offer't; in yourconscience, now, is it not?'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and thecowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' donethis slaughter: besides, they have burned andcarried away all that was in the king's tent;wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused everysoldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis agallant king!Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. Whatcall you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!Alexander the Great.Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or thegreat, or the mighty, or the huge, or themagnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phraseis a little variations.I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; hisfather was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. Itell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisonsbetween Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,look you, is both alike. There is a river inMacedon; and there is also moreover a river atMonmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it isout of my prains what is the name of the otherriver; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers isto my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If youmark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's lifeis come after it indifferent well; for there isfigures in all things. Alexander, God knows, andyou know, in his rages, and his furies, and hiswraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and hisdispleasures, and his indignations, and also being alittle intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales andhis angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.Our king is not like him in that: he never killedany of his friends.It is not well done, mark you now take the tales outof my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speakbut in the figures and comparisons of it: asAlexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in hisales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being inhis right wits and his good judgments, turned awaythe fat knight with the great belly-doublet: hewas full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, andmocks; I have forgot his name.Sir John Falstaff.That is he: I'll tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth.Here comes his majesty.I was not angry since I came to FranceUntil this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:If they will fight with us, bid them come down,Or void the field; they do offend our sight:If they'll do neither, we will come to them,And make them skirr away, as swift as stonesEnforced from the old Assyrian slings:Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,And not a man of them that we shall takeShall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.His eyes are humbler than they used to be.How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou notThat I have  fined these bones of mine for ransom?Comest thou again for ransom?No, great king:I come to thee for charitable licence,That we may wander o'er this bloody fieldTo look our dead, and then to bury them;To sort our nobles from our common men.For many of our princes--woe the while!--Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbsIn blood of princes; and their wounded steedsFret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rageYerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,To view the field in safety and disposeOf their dead bodies!I tell thee truly, herald,I know not if the day be ours or no;For yet a many of your horsemen peerAnd gallop o'er the field.The day is yours.Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?They call it Agincourt.Then call we this the field of Agincourt,Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please yourmajesty, and your great-uncle Edward the PlackPrince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles,fought a most prave pattle here in France.They did, Fluellen.Your majesty says very true: if your majesties isremembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in agarden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in theirMonmouth caps; which, your majesty know, to thishour is an honourable badge of the service; and I dobelieve your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leekupon Saint Tavy's day.I wear it for a memorable honour;For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty'sWelsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:God pless it and preserve it, as long as it pleaseshis grace, and his majesty too!Thanks, good my countryman.By Jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman, I care notwho know it; I will confess it to all the 'orld: Ineed not to be ashamed of your majesty, praised beGod, so long as your majesty is an honest man.God keep me so! Our heralds go with him:Bring me just notice of the numbers deadOn both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.Soldier, you must come to the king.Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?An't please your majesty, 'tis the gage of one thatI should fight withal, if he be alive.An Englishman?An't please your majesty, a rascal that swaggeredwith me last night; who, if alive and ever dare tochallenge this glove, I have sworn to take him a boxo' th' ear: or if I can see my glove in his cap,which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wearif alive, I will strike it out soundly.What think you, Captain Fluellen? is it fit thissoldier keep his oath?He is a craven and a villain else, an't please yourmajesty, in my conscience.It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort,quite from the answer of his degree.Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, asLucifer and Belzebub himself, it is necessary, lookyour grace, that he keep his vow and his oath: ifhe be perjured, see you now, his reputation is asarrant a villain and a Jacksauce, as ever his blackshoe trod upon God's ground and his earth, in myconscience, la!Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meetest the fellow.So I will, my liege, as I live.Who servest thou under?Under Captain Gower, my liege.Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge andliteratured in the wars.Call him hither to me, soldier.I will, my liege.Here, Fluellen; wear thou this favour for me andstick it in thy cap: when Alencon and myself weredown together, I plucked this glove from his helm:if any man challenge this, he is a friend toAlencon, and an enemy to our person; if thouencounter any such, apprehend him, an thou dost me love.Your grace doo's me as great honours as can bedesired in the hearts of his subjects: I would fainsee the man, that has but two legs, that shall findhimself aggrieved at this glove; that is all; but Iwould fain see it once, an please God of his gracethat I might see.Knowest thou Gower?He is my dear friend, an please you.Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.I will fetch him.My Lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester,Follow Fluellen closely at the heels:The glove which I have given him for a favourMay haply purchase him a box o' th' ear;It is the soldier's; I by bargain shouldWear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick:If that the soldier strike him, as I judgeBy his blunt bearing he will keep his word,Some sudden mischief may arise of it;For I do know Fluellen valiantAnd, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,And quickly will return an injury:Follow and see there be no harm between them.Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.
