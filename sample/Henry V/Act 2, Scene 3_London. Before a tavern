Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.No; for my manly heart doth yearn.Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,And we must yearn therefore.Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either inheaven or in hell!Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur'sbosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' madea finer end and went away an it had been anychristom child; a' parted even just between twelveand one, even at the turning o' the tide: for afterI saw him fumble with the sheets and play withflowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knewthere was but one way; for his nose was as sharp asa pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,sir John!' quoth I	'what, man! be o' goodcheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three orfour times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'should not think of God; I hoped there was no needto trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. Soa' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put myhand into the bed and felt them, and they were ascold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, andthey were as cold as any stone, and so upward andupward, and all was as cold as any stone.They say he cried out of sack.Ay, that a' did.And of women.Nay, that a' did not.Yes, that a' did; and said they were devilsincarnate.A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour henever liked.A' said once, the devil would have him about women.A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but thenhe was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick uponBardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soulburning in hell-fire?Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:that's all the riches I got in his service.Shall we shog? the king will be gone fromSouthampton.Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.Look to my chattels and my movables:Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'Trust none;For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.Go, clear thy c rystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!And that's but unwholesome food they say.Touch her soft mouth, and march.Farewell, hostess.I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but, adieu.Let housewifery appear: keep close, I thee command.Farewell; adieu.
