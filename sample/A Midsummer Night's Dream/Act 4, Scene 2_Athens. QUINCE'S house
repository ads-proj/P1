Have you sent to Bottom's house ? is he come home yet?He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he istransported.If he come not, then the play is marred: it goesnot forward, doth it?It is not possible: you have not a man in allAthens able to discharge Pyramus but he.No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraftman in Athens.Yea and the best person too; and he is a veryparamour for a sweet voice.You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,a thing of naught.Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, andthere is two or three lords and ladies more married:if our sport had gone forward, we had all been mademen.O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence aday during his life; he could not have 'scapedsixpence a day: an the duke had not given himsixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;he would have deserved it: sixpence a day inPyramus, or nothing.Where are these lads? where are these hearts?Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me notwhat; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. Iwill tell you every thing, right as it fell out.Let us hear, sweet Bottom.Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, thatthe duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,good strings to your beards, new ribbons to yourpumps; meet presently at the palace; every man looko'er his part; for the short and the long is, ourplay is preferred. In any case, let Thisby haveclean linen; and let not him that plays the lionpair his nails, for they shall hang out for thelion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onionsnor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and Ido not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweetcomedy. No more words: away! go, away!
