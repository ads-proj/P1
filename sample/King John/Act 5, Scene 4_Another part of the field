I did not think the king so stored with friends.Up once again; put spirit in the French:If they miscarry, we miscarry too.That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.They say King John sore sick hath left the field.Lead me to the revolts of England here.When we were happy we had other names.It is the Count Melun.Wounded to death.Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;Unthread the rude eye of rebellionAnd welcome home again discarded faith.Seek out King John and fall before his feet;For if the French be lords of this loud day,He means to recompense the pains you takeBy cutting off your heads: thus hath he swornAnd I with him, and many moe with me,Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;Even on that altar where we swore to youDear amity and everlasting love.May this be possible? may this be true?Have I not hideous death within my view,Retaining but a quantity of life,Which bleeds away, even as a form of waxResolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?What in the world should make me now deceive,Since I must lose the use of all deceit?Why should I then be false, since it is trueThat I must die here and live hence by truth?I say again, if Lewis do win the day,He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yoursBehold another day break in the east:But even this night, whose black contagious breathAlready smokes about the burning crestOf the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,Paying the fine of rated treacheryEven with a treacherous fine of all your lives,If Lewis by your assistance win the day.Commend me to one Hubert with your king:The love of him, and this respect besides,For that my grandsire was an Englishman,Awakes my conscience to confess all this.In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me henceFrom forth the noise and rumour of the field,Where I may think the remnant of my thoughtsIn peace, and part this body and my soulWith contemplation and devout desires.We do believe thee: and beshrew my soulBut I do love the favour and the formOf this most fair occasion, by the whichWe will untread the steps of damned flight,And like a bated and retired flood,Leaving our rankness and irregular course,Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'dAnd cabby run on in obedienceEven to our ocean, to our great King John.My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;For I do see the cruel pangs of deathRight in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;And happy newness, that intends old right.
