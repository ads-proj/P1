Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly manIs but a substance that must yield to you;And I, as fits my nature, do obey you:Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breathNothing to think on but ensuing death:Let it suffice the greatness of your powersTo have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;And having thrown him from your watery grave,Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.What, ho, Pilch!Ha, come and bring away the nets!What, Patch-breech, I say!What say you, master?Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or I'llfetch thee with a wanion.Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men thatwere cast away before us even now.Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear whatpitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw theporpus how he bounced and tumbled? they saythey're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, Imarvel how the fishes live in the sea.Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up thelittle ones: I can compare our rich misers tonothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays andtumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and atlast devours them all at a mouthful: such whaleshave I heard on o' the land, who never leave gapingtill they've swallowed the whole parish, church,steeple, bells, and all.[Aside]  A pretty moral.But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would havebeen that day in the belfry.Why, man?Because he should have swallowed me too: and when Ihad been in his belly, I would have kept such ajangling of the bells, that he should never haveleft, till he cast bells, steeple, church, andparish up again. But if the good King Simonideswere of my mind,--[Aside]  Simonides!We would purge the land of these drones, that robthe bee of her honey.[Aside]  How from the finny subject of the seaThese fishers tell the infirmities of men;And from their watery empire recollectAll that may men approve or men detect!Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen.Honest! good fellow, what's that? If it be a dayfits you, search out of the calendar, and nobodylook after it.May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in ourway!A man whom both the waters and the wind,In that vast tennis-court, have made the ballFor them to play upon, entreats you pity him:He asks of you, that never used to beg.No, friend, cannot you beg? Here's them in ourcountry Greece gets more with begging than we can dowith working.Canst thou catch any fishes, then?I never practised it.Nay, then thou wilt starve, sure; for here's nothingto be got now-a-days, unless thou canst fish for't.What I have been I have forgot to know;But what I am, want teaches me to think on:A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are chill,And have no more of life than may sufficeTo give my tongue that heat to ask your help;Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,For that I am a man, pray see me buried.Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here;come, put it on; keep thee warm. Now, afore me, ahandsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, andwe'll have flesh for holidays, fish forfasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks,and thou shalt be welcome.I thank you, sir.Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg.I did but crave.But crave! Then I'll turn craver too, and so Ishall 'scape whipping.Why, are all your beggars whipped, then?O, not all, my friend, not all; for if all yourbeggars were whipped, I would wish no better officethan to be beadle. But, master, I'll go draw up thenet.[Aside]  How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!Hark you, sir, do you know where ye are?Not well.Why, I'll tell you: this is called Pentapolis, andour king the good Simonides.The good King Simonides, do you call him.Ay, sir; and he deserves so to be called for hispeaceable reign and good government.He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjectsthe name of good by his government. How far is hiscourt distant from this shore?Marry, sir, half a day's journey: and I'll tellyou, he hath a fair daughter, and to-morrow is herbirth-day; and there are princes and knights comefrom all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wishto make one there.O, sir, things must be as they may; and what a mancannot get, he may lawfully deal for--his wife's soul.Help, master, help! here's a fish hangs in the net,like a poor man's right in the law; 'twill hardlycome out. Ha! bots on't, 'tis come at last, and'tis turned to a rusty armour.An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,Which my dead father did bequeath to me.With this strict charge, even as he left his life,'Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shieldTwixt me and death;'--and pointed to this brace;--'For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity--The which the gods protect thee from!--maydefend thee.'It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,Took it in rage, though calm'd have given't again:I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,Since I have here my father's gift in's will.What mean you, sir?To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,For it was sometime target to a king;I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,And for his sake I wish the having of it;And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,Where with it I may appear a gentleman;And if that ever my low fortune's better,I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.Why, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on't!Ay, but hark you, my friend; 'twas we that made upthis garment through the rough seams of the waters:there are certain condolements, certain vails. Ihope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember fromwhence you had it.Believe 't, I will.By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,This jewel holds his building on my arm:Unto thy value I will mount myselfUpon a courser, whose delightful stepsShall make the gazer joy to see him tread.Only, my friend, I yet am unprovidedOf a pair of bases.We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown tomake thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.Then honour be but a goal to my will,This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill.
