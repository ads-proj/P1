Most honour'd Cleon, I must needs be gone;My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus standsIn a litigious peace. You, and your lady,Take from my heart all thankfulness! The godsMake up the rest upon you!Your shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally,Yet glance full wanderingly on us.O your sweet queen!That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither,To have bless'd mine eyes with her!We cannot but obeyThe powers above us. Could I rage and roarAs doth the sea she lies in, yet the endMust be as 'tis. My gentle babe Marina, whom,For she was born at sea, I have named so, hereI charge your charity withal, leaving herThe infant of your care; beseeching youTo give her princely training, that she may beManner'd as she is born.Fear not, my lord, but thinkYour grace, that fed my country with your corn,For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,Must in your child be thought on. If neglectionShould therein make me vile, the common body,By you relieved, would force me to my duty:But if to that my nature need a spur,The gods revenge it upon me and mine,To the end of generation!I believe you;Your honour and your goodness teach me to't,Without your vows. Till she be married, madam,By bright Diana, whom we honour, allUnscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain,Though I show ill in't. So I take my leave.Good madam, make me blessed in your careIn bringing up my child.I have one myself,Who shall not be more dear to my respectThan yours, my lord.Madam, my thanks and prayers.We'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore,Then give you up to the mask'd Neptune andThe gentlest winds of heaven.I will embraceYour offer. Come, dearest madam. O, no tears,Lychorida, no tears:Look to your little mistress, on whose graceYou may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.
