So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must Ikill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure tobe hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceivehe was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,being bid to ask what he would of the king, desiredhe might know none of his secrets: now do I see hehad some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be avillain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath tobe one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,Further to question me of your king's departure:His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.[Aside]  How! the king gone!If further yet you will be satisfied,Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.Being at Antioch--[Aside]          What from Antioch?Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,With whom each minute threatens life or death.[Aside]  Well, I perceiveI shall not be hang'd now, although I would;But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.From him I comeWith message unto princely Pericles;But since my landing I have understoodYour lord has betook himself to unknown travels,My message must return from whence it came.We have no reason to desire it,Commended to our master, not to us:Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.
