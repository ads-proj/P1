near the altar, as high priestess; a number ofVirgins on each side; CERIMON and other Inhabitantsof Ephesus attending.Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,I here confess myself the king of Tyre;Who, frighted from my country, did wedAt Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.At sea in childbed died she, but brought forthA maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,Wears yet thy silver livery. She at TarsusWas nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen yearsHe sought to murder: but her better starsBrought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shoreRiding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,Where, by her own most clear remembrance, sheMade known herself my daughter.Voice and favour!You are, you are--O royal Pericles!What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!Noble sir,If you have told Diana's altar true,This is your wife.Reverend appearer, no;I threw her overboard with these very arms.Upon this coast, I warrant you.'Tis most certain.Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.Early in blustering morn this lady wasThrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed herHere in Diana's temple.May we see them?Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.O, let me look!If he be none of mine, my sanctityWill to my sense bend no licentious ear,But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,A birth, and death?The voice of dead Thaisa!That Thaisa am I, supposed deadAnd drown'd.Immortal Dian!Now I know you better.When we with tears parted Pentapolis,The king my father gave you such a ring.This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindnessMakes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,That on the touching of her lips I mayMelt and no more be seen. O, come, be buriedA second time within these arms.My heartLeaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;Thy burden at the sea, and call'd MarinaFor she was yielded there.Blest, and mine own!Hail, madam, and my queen!I know you not.You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,I left behind an ancient substitute:Can you remember what I call'd the man?I have named him oft.'Twas Helicanus then.Still confirmation:Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.Now do I long to hear how you were found;How possibly preserved; and who to thank,Besides the gods, for this great miracle.Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,Through whom the gods have shown their power; that canFrom first to last resolve you.Reverend sir,The gods can have no mortal officerMore like a god than you. Will you deliverHow this dead queen re-lives?I will, my lord.Beseech you, first go with me to my house,Where shall be shown you all was found with her;How she came placed here in the temple;No needful thing omitted.Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! IWill offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,This ornamentMakes me look dismal will I clip to form;And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,My father's dead.Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselvesWill in that kingdom spend our following days:Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stayTo hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.In Antiochus and his daughter you have heardOf monstrous lust the due and just reward:In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:In Helicanus may you well descryA figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:In reverend Cerimon there well appearsThe worth that learned charity aye wears:For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fameHad spread their cursed deed, and honour'd nameOf Pericles, to rage the city turn,That him and his they in his palace burn;The gods for murder seemed so contentTo punish them; although not done, but meant.So, on your patience evermore attending,New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.
