Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her shehad ne'er come here.Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the godPriapus, and undo a whole generation. We musteither get her ravished, or be rid of her. When sheshould do for clients her fitment, and do me thekindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, herknees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,if he should cheapen a kiss of her.'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish usof all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by theway to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.We should have both lord and lown, if the peevishbaggage would but give way to customers.How now! How a dozen of virginities?Now, the gods to-bless your honour!I am glad to see your honour in good health.You may so; 'tis the better for you that yourresorters stand upon sound legs. How now!wholesome iniquity have you that a man may dealwithal, and defy the surgeon?We have here one, sir, if she would--but there nevercame her like in Mytilene.If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.Well, call forth, call forth.For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shallsee a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--What, prithee?O, sir, I can be modest.That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than itgives a good report to a number to be chaste.Here comes that which grows to the stalk; neverplucked yet, I can assure you.Is she not a fair creature?'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.Well, there's for you: leave us.I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, andI'll have done presently.I beseech you, do.[To MARINA]  First, I would have you note, this isan honourable man.I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.Next, he's the governor of this country, and a manwhom I am bound to.If he govern the country, you are bound to himindeed; but how honourable he is in that, I know not.Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, willyou use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.Ha' you done?My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take somepains to work her to your manage. Come, we willleave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?What trade, sir?Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.How long have you been of this profession?E'er since I can remember.Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester atfive or at seven?Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be acreature of sale.Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,and will come into 't? I hear say you are ofhonourable parts, and are the governor of this place.Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?Who is my principal?Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and rootsof shame and iniquity. O, you have heard somethingof my power, and so stand aloof for more seriouswooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, myauthority shall not see thee, or else look friendlyupon thee. Come, bring me to some private place:come, come.If you were born to honour, show it now;If put upon you, make the judgment goodThat thought you worthy of it.How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.For me,That am a maid, though most ungentle fortuneHave placed me in this sty, where, since I came,Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,O, that the godsWould set me free from this unhallow'd place,Though they did change me to the meanest birdThat flies i' the purer air!I did not thinkThou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee:Persever in that clear way thou goest,And the gods strengthen thee!The good gods preserve you!For me, be you thoughtenThat I came with no ill intent; for to meThe very doors and windows savour vilely.Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, andI doubt not but thy training hath been noble.Hold, here's more gold for thee.A curse upon him, die he like a thief,That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dostHear from me, it shall be for thy good.I beseech your honour, one piece for me.Avaunt, thou damned door-keeper!Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!How's this? We must take another course with you.If your peevish chastity, which is not worth abreakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded likea spaniel. Come your ways.Whither would you have me?I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the commonhangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'llhave no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.How now! what's the matter?Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holywords to the Lord Lysimachus.O abominable!She makes our profession as it were to stink aforethe face of the gods.Marry, hang her up for ever!The nobleman would have dealt with her like anobleman, and she sent him away as cold as asnowball; saying his prayers too.Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.An if she were a thornier piece of ground than sheis, she shall be ploughed.Hark, hark, you gods!She conjures: away with her! Would she had nevercome within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's bornto undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!Come, mistress; come your ways with me.Whither wilt thou have me?To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.Prithee, tell me one thing first.Come now, your one thing.What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.Neither of these are so bad as thou art,Since they do better thee in their command.Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiendOf hell would not in reputation change:Thou art the damned doorkeeper to everyCoistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;To the choleric fisting of every rogueThy ear is liable; thy food is suchAs hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.What would you have me do? go to the wars, wouldyou? where a man may serve seven years for the lossof a leg, and have not money enough in the end tobuy him a wooden one?Do any thing but this thou doest. EmptyOLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth;Serve by indenture to the common hangman:Any of these ways are yet better than this;For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,Would own a name too dear. O, that the godsWould safely deliver me from this place!Here, here's gold for thee.If that thy master would gain by thee,Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:And I will undertake all these to teach.I doubt not but this populous city willYield many scholars.But can you teach all this you speak of?Prove that I cannot, take me home again,And prostitute me to the basest groomThat doth frequent your house.Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I canplace thee, I will.But amongst honest women.'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.But since my master and mistress have bought you,there's no going but by their consent: therefore Iwill make them acquainted with your purpose, and Idoubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.Come, I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chancesInto an honest house, our story says.She sings like one immortal, and she dancesAs goddess-like to her admired lays;Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composesNature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,That even her art sisters the natural roses;Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:That pupils lacks she none of noble race,Who pour their bounty on her; and her gainShe gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;And to her father turn our thoughts again,Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrivedHere where his daughter dwells; and on this coastSuppose him now at anchor. The city strivedGod Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whenceLysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;And to him in his barge with fervor hies.In your supposing once more put your sightOf heavy Pericles; think this his bark:Where what is done in action, more, if might,Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.
