You're well met once again.So are you.You come to take your stand here, and beholdThe Lady Anne pass from her coronation?'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;This, general joy.'Tis well: the citizens,I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward--In celebration of this day with shows,Pageants and sights of honour.Never greater,Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.May I be bold to ask at what that contains,That paper in your hand?Yes; 'tis the listOf those that claim their offices this dayBy custom of the coronation.The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claimsTo be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,I should have been beholding to your paper.But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,The princess dowager? how goes her business?That I can tell you too. The ArchbishopOf Canterbury, accompanied with otherLearned and reverend fathers of his order,Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles offFrom Ampthill where the princess lay; to whichShe was often cited by them, but appear'd not:And, to be short, for not appearance andThe king's late scruple, by the main assentOf all these learned men she was divorced,And the late marriage made of none effectSince which she was removed to Kimbolton,Where she remains now sick.Alas, good lady!The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.1. A lively flourish of Trumpets.2. Then, two Judges.3. Lord Chancellor, with the purse and macebefore him.4. Choristers, singing.5. Mayor of London, bearing the mace. ThenGarter, in his coat of arms, and on hishead a gilt copper crown.6. Marquess Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold,on his head a demi-coronal of gold. Withhim, SURREY, bearing the rod of silver withthe dove, crowned with an earl's coronet.Collars of SS.7. SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coroneton his head, bearing a long white wand, ashigh-steward. With him, NORFOLK, with therod of marshalship, a coronet on his head.Collars of SS.8. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports;under it, QUEEN ANNE in her robe; in her hairrichly adorned with pearl, crowned. On eachside her, the Bishops of London andWinchester.9. The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal ofgold, wrought with flowers, bearing QUEENANNE's train.10. Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plaincirclets of gold without flowers.A royal train, believe me. These I know:Who's that that bears the sceptre?Marquess Dorset:And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.A bold brave gentleman. That should beThe Duke of Suffolk?'Tis the same: high-steward.And that my Lord of Norfolk?Yes;Heaven bless thee!Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;Our king has all the Indies in his arms,And more and richer, when he strains that lady:I cannot blame his conscience.They that bearThe cloth of honour over her, are four baronsOf the Cinque-ports.Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.I take it, she that carries up the trainIs that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.It is; and all the rest are countesses.Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;And sometimes falling ones.No more of that.God save you, sir! where have you been broiling?Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a fingerCould not be wedged in more: I am stifledWith the mere rankness of their joy.You sawThe ceremony?That I did.How was it?Well worth the seeing.Good sir, speak it to us.As well as I am able. The rich streamOf lords and ladies, having brought the queenTo a prepared place in the choir, fell offA distance from her; while her grace sat downTo rest awhile, some half an hour or so,In a rich chair of state, opposing freelyThe beauty of her person to the people.Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest womanThat ever lay by man: which when the peopleHad the full view of, such a noise aroseAs the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their facesBeen loose, this day they had been lost. Such joyI never saw before. Great-bellied women,That had not half a week to go, like ramsIn the old time of war, would shake the press,And make 'em reel before 'em. No man livingCould say 'This is my wife' there; all were wovenSo strangely in one piece.But, what follow'd?At length her grace rose, and with modest pacesCame to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-likeCast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:When by the Archbishop of CanterburyShe had all the royal makings of a queen;As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblemsLaid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,With all the choicest music of the kingdom,Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,And with the same full state paced back againTo York-place, where the feast is held.Sir,You must no more call it York-place, that's past;For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.I know it;But 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old nameIs fresh about me.What two reverend bishopsWere those that went on each side of the queen?Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,The other, London.He of WinchesterIs held no great good lover of the archbishop's,The virtuous Cranmer.All the land knows that:However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.Who may that be, I pray you?Thomas Cromwell;A man in much esteem with the king, and trulyA worthy friend. The king has made him masterO' the jewel house,And one, already, of the privy council.He will deserve more.Yes, without all doubt.Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, whichIs to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:Something I can command. As I walk thither,I'll tell ye more.You may command us, sir.
