I come no more to make you laugh: things now,That bear a weighty and a serious brow,Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,We now present. Those that can pity, hereMay, if they think it well, let fall a tear;The subject will deserve it. Such as giveTheir money out of hope they may believe,May here find truth too. Those that come to seeOnly a show or two, and so agreeThe play may pass, if they be still and willing,I'll undertake may see away their shillingRichly in two short hours. Only theyThat come to hear a merry bawdy play,A noise of targets, or to see a fellowIn a long motley coat guarded with yellow,Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,To rank our chosen truth with such a showAs fool and fight is, beside forfeitingOur own brains, and the opinion that we bring,To make that only true we now intend,Will leave us never an understanding friend.Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are knownThe first and happiest hearers of the town,Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye seeThe very persons of our noble storyAs they were living; think you see them great,And follow'd with the general throng and sweatOf thousand friends; then in a moment, seeHow soon this mightiness meets misery:And, if you can be merry then, I'll sayA man may weep upon his wedding-day.
