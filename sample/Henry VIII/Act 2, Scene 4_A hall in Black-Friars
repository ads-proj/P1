Whilst our commission from Rome is read,Let silence be commanded.What's the need?It hath already publicly been read,And on all sides the authority allow'd;You may, then, spare that time.Be't so. Proceed.Say, Henry King of England, come into the court.Henry King of England,  & c.Here.Say, Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.Katharine Queen of England,  & c.Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;And to bestow your pity on me: forI am a most poor woman, and a stranger,Born out of your dominions; having hereNo judge indifferent, nor no more assuranceOf equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,In what have I offended you? what causeHath my behavior given to your displeasure,That thus you should proceed to put me off,And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,I have been to you a true and humble wife,At all times to your will conformable;Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorryAs I saw it inclined: when was the hourI ever contradicted your desire,Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friendsHave I not strove to love, although I knewHe were mine enemy? what friend of mineThat had to him derived your anger, did IContinue in my liking? nay, gave noticeHe was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mindThat I have been your wife, in this obedience,Upward of twenty years, and have been blestWith many children by you: if, in the courseAnd process of this time, you can report,And prove it too, against mine honour aught,My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,Against your sacred person, in God's name,Turn me away; and let the foul'st contemptShut door upon me, and so give me upTo the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,The king, your father, was reputed forA prince most prudent, of an excellentAnd unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd oneThe wisest prince that there had reign'd by manyA year before: it is not to be question'dThat they had gather'd a wise council to themOf every realm, that did debate this business,Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humblyBeseech you, sir, to spare me, till I mayBe by my friends in Spain advised; whose counselI will implore: if not, i' the name of God,Your pleasure be fulfill'd!You have here, lady,And of your choice, these reverend fathers; menOf singular integrity and learning,Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembledTo plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootlessThat longer you desire the court; as wellFor your own quiet, as to rectifyWhat is unsettled in the king.His graceHath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,It's fit this royal session do proceed;And that, without delay, their argumentsBe now produced and heard.Lord cardinal,To you I speak.Your pleasure, madam?Sir,I am about to weep; but, thinking thatWe are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certainThe daughter of a king, my drops of tearsI'll turn to sparks of fire.Be patient yet.I will, when you are humble; nay, before,Or God will punish me. I do believe,Induced by potent circumstances, thatYou are mine enemy, and make my challengeYou shall not be my judge: for it is youHave blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,I utterly abhor, yea, from my soulRefuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,I hold my most malicious foe, and think notAt all a friend to truth.I do professYou speak not like yourself; who ever yetHave stood to charity, and display'd the effectsOf disposition gentle, and of wisdomO'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:I have no spleen against you; nor injusticeFor you or any: how far I have proceeded,Or how far further shall, is warrantedBy a commission from the consistory,Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge meThat I have blown this coal: I do deny it:The king is present: if it be known to himThat I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as muchAs you have done my truth. If he knowThat I am free of your report, he knowsI am not of your wrong. Therefore in himIt lies to cure me: and the cure is, toRemove these thoughts from you: the which beforeHis highness shall speak in, I do beseechYou, gracious madam, to unthink your speakingAnd to say so no more.My lord, my lord,I am a simple woman, much too weakTo oppose your cunning. You're meek andhumble-mouth'd;You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,With meekness and humility; but your heartIs cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mountedWhere powers are your retainers, and your words,Domestics to you, serve your will as't pleaseYourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,You tender more your person's honour thanYour high profession spiritual: that againI do refuse you for my judge; and here,Before you all, appeal unto the pope,To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,And to be judged by him.The queen is obstinate,Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, andDisdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.She's going away.Call her again.Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.Madam, you are call'd back.What need you note it? pray you, keep your way:When you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help,They vex me past my patience! Pray you, pass on:I will not tarry; no, nor ever moreUpon this business my appearance makeIn any of their courts.Go thy ways, Kate:That man i' the world who shall report he hasA better wife, let him in nought be trusted,For speaking false in that: thou art, alone,If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,Obeying in commanding, and thy partsSovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;And, like her true nobility, she hasCarried herself towards me.Most gracious sir,In humblest manner I require your highness,That it shall please you to declare, in hearingOf all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound,There must I be unloosed, although not thereAt once and fully satisfied,--whether ever IDid broach this business to your highness; orLaid any scruple in your way, which mightInduce you to the question on't? or everHave to you, but with thanks to God for suchA royal lady, spake one the least word that mightBe to the prejudice of her present state,Or touch of her good person?My lord cardinal,I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,I free you from't. You are not to be taughtThat you have many enemies, that know notWhy they are so, but, like to village-curs,Bark when their fellows do: by some of theseThe queen is put in anger. You're excused:But will you be more justified? You everHave wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desiredIt to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,The passages made toward it: on my honour,I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,I will be bold with time and your attention:Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:My conscience first received a tenderness,Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'dBy the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;Who had been hither sent on the debatingA marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans andOur daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,Ere a determinate resolution, he,I mean the bishop, did require a respite;Wherein he might the king his lord advertiseWhether our daughter were legitimate,Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shookThe bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,Yea, with a splitting power, and made to trembleThe region of my breast; which forced such way,That many mazed considerings did throngAnd press'd in with this caution. First, methoughtI stood not in the smile of heaven; who hadCommanded nature, that my lady's womb,If it conceived a male child by me, shouldDo no more offices of life to't thanThe grave does to the dead; for her male issueOr died where they were made, or shortly afterThis world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should notBe gladded in't by me: then follows, thatI weigh'd the danger which my realms stood inBy this my issue's fail; and that gave to meMany a groaning throe. Thus hulling inThe wild sea of my conscience, I did steerToward this remedy, whereupon we areNow present here together: that's to say,I meant to rectify my conscience,--whichI then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--By all the reverend fathers of the landAnd doctors learn'd: first I began in privateWith you, my Lord of Lincoln; you rememberHow under my oppression I did reek,When I first moved you.Very well, my liege.I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to sayHow far you satisfied me.So please your highness,The question did at first so stagger me,Bearing a state of mighty moment in'tAnd consequence of dread, that I committedThe daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;And did entreat your highness to this courseWhich you are running here.I then moved you,My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leaveTo make this present summons: unsolicitedI left no reverend person in this court;But by particular consent proceededUnder your hands and seals: therefore, go on:For no dislike i' the world against the personOf the good queen, but the sharp thorny pointsOf my alleged reasons, drive this forward:Prove but our marriage lawful, by my lifeAnd kingly dignity, we are contentedTo wear our mortal state to come with her,Katharine our queen, before the primest creatureThat's paragon'd o' the world.So please your highness,The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitnessThat we adjourn this court till further day:Meanwhile must be an earnest motionMade to the queen, to call back her appealShe intends unto his holiness.[Aside]	I may perceiveThese cardinals trifle with me: I abhorThis dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,My comfort comes along. Break up the court:I say, set on.
