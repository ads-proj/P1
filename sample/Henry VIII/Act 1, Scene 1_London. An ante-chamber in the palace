Good morrow, and well met. How have ye doneSince last we saw in France?I thank your grace,Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirerOf what I saw there.An untimely agueStay'd me a prisoner in my chamber whenThose suns of glory, those two lights of men,Met in the vale of Andren.'Twixt Guynes and Arde:I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clungIn their embracement, as they grew together;Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'dSuch a compounded one?All the whole timeI was my chamber's prisoner.Then you lostThe view of earthly glory: men might say,Till this time pomp was single, but now marriedTo one above itself. Each following dayBecame the next day's master, till the lastMade former wonders its. To-day the French,All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, theyMade Britain India: every man that stoodShow'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages wereAs cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bearThe pride upon them, that their very labourWas to them as a painting: now this masqueWas cried incomparable; and the ensuing nightMade it a fool and beggar. The two kings,Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,As presence did present them; him in eye,Still him in praise: and, being present both'Twas said they saw but one; and no discernerDurst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challengedThe noble spirits to arms, they did performBeyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,Being now seen possible enough, got credit,That Bevis was believed.O, you go far.As I belong to worship and affectIn honour honesty, the tract of every thingWould by a good discourser lose some life,Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.Order gave each thing view; the office didDistinctly his full function.Who did guide,I mean, who set the body and the limbsOf this great sport together, as you guess?One, certes, that promises no elementIn such a business.I pray you, who, my lord?All this was order'd by the good discretionOf the right reverend Cardinal of York.The devil speed him! no man's pie is freedFrom his ambitious finger. What had heTo do in these fierce vanities? I wonderThat such a keech can with his very bulkTake up the rays o' the beneficial sunAnd keep it from the earth.Surely, sir,There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose graceChalks successors their way, nor call'd uponFor high feats done to the crown; neither alliedFor eminent assistants; but, spider-like,Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,The force of his own merit makes his wayA gift that heaven gives for him, which buysA place next to the king.I cannot tellWhat heaven hath given him,--let some graver eyePierce into that; but I can see his pridePeep through each part of him: whence has he that,If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,Or has given all before, and he beginsA new hell in himself.Why the devil,Upon this French going out, took he upon him,Without the privity o' the king, to appointWho should attend on him? He makes up the fileOf all the gentry; for the most part suchTo whom as great a charge as little honourHe meant to lay upon: and his own letter,The honourable board of council out,Must fetch him in the papers.I do knowKinsmen of mine, three at the least, that haveBy this so sickened their estates, that neverThey shall abound as formerly.O, manyHave broke their backs with laying manors on 'emFor this great journey. What did this vanityBut minister communication ofA most poor issue?Grievingly I think,The peace between the French and us not valuesThe cost that did conclude it.Every man,After the hideous storm that follow'd, wasA thing inspired; and, not consulting, brokeInto a general prophecy; That this tempest,Dashing the garment of this peace, abodedThe sudden breach on't.Which is budded out;For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'dOur merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.Is it thereforeThe ambassador is silenced?Marry, is't.A proper title of a peace; and purchasedAt a superfluous rate!Why, all this businessOur reverend cardinal carried.Like it your grace,The state takes notice of the private differenceBetwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--And take it from a heart that wishes towards youHonour and plenteous safety--that you readThe cardinal's malice and his potencyTogether; to consider further thatWhat his high hatred would effect wants notA minister in his power. You know his nature,That he's revengeful, and I know his swordHath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rockThat I advise your shunning.The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?Where's his examination?Here, so please you.Is he in person ready?Ay, please your grace.Well, we shall then know more; and BuckinghamShall lessen this big look.This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and IHave not the power to muzzle him; therefore bestNot wake him in his slumber. A beggar's bookOutworths a noble's blood.What, are you chafed?Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance onlyWhich your disease requires.I read in's looksMatter against me; and his eye reviledMe, as his abject object: at this instantHe bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;I'll follow and outstare him.Stay, my lord,And let your reason with your choler questionWhat 'tis you go about: to climb steep hillsRequires slow pace at first: anger is likeA full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in EnglandCan advise me like you: be to yourselfAs you would to your friend.I'll to the king;And from a mouth of honour quite cry downThis Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaimThere's difference in no persons.Be advised;Heat not a furnace for your foe so hotThat it do singe yourself: we may outrun,By violent swiftness, that which we run at,And lose by over-running. Know you not,The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:I say again, there is no English soulMore stronger to direct you than yourself,If with the sap of reason you would quench,Or but allay, the fire of passion.Sir,I am thankful to you; and I'll go alongBy your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,Whom from the flow of gall I name not butFrom sincere motions, by intelligence,And proofs as clear as founts in July whenWe see each grain of gravel, I do knowTo be corrupt and treasonous.Say not 'treasonous.'To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strongAs shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenousAs he is subtle, and as prone to mischiefAs able to perform't; his mind and placeInfecting one another, yea, reciprocally--Only to show his pomp as well in FranceAs here at home, suggests the king our masterTo this last costly treaty, the interview,That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glassDid break i' the rinsing.Faith, and so it did.Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinalThe articles o' the combination drewAs himself pleased; and they were ratifiedAs he cried 'Thus let be': to as much endAs give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinalHas done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppyTo the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--For 'twas indeed his colour, but he cameTo whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:His fears were, that the interview betwixtEngland and France might, through their amity,Breed him some prejudice; for from this leaguePeep'd harms that menaced him: he privilyDeals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--Which I do well; for I am sure the emperorPaid ere he promised; whereby his suit was grantedEre it was ask'd; but when the way was made,And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,That he would please to alter the king's course,And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinalDoes buy and sell his honour as he pleases,And for his own advantage.I am sorryTo hear this of him; and could wish he wereSomething mistaken in't.No, not a syllable:I  do pronounce him in that very shapeHe shall appear in proof.Your office, sergeant; execute it.Sir,My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and EarlOf Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, IArrest thee of high treason, in the nameOf our most sovereign king.Lo, you, my lord,The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perishUnder device and practise.I am sorryTo see you ta'en from liberty, to look onThe business present: 'tis his highness' pleasureYou shall to the Tower.It will help me nothingTo plead mine innocence; for that dye is on meWhich makes my whitest part black. The will of heavenBe done in this and all things! I obey.O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!Nay, he must bear you company. The kingIs pleased you shall to the Tower, till you knowHow he determines further.As the duke said,The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasureBy me obey'd!Here is a warrant fromThe king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodiesOf the duke's confessor, John de la Car,One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--So, so;These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope.A monk o' the Chartreux.O, Nicholas Hopkins?He.My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinalHath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,By darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell.
