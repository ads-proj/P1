Will you think so?Think so, Iago!What,To kiss in private?An unauthorized kiss.Or to be naked with her friend in bedAn hour or more, not meaning any harm?Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!It is hypocrisy against the devil:They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--What then?Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,She may, I think, bestow't on any man.She is protectress of her honour too:May she give that?Her honour is an essence that's not seen;They have it very oft that have it not:But, for the handkerchief,--By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,As doth the raven o'er the infected house,Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.Ay, what of that?That's not so good now.What,If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,Who having, by their own importunate suit,Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,Convinced or supplied them, cannot chooseBut they must blab--Hath he said any thing?He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,No more than he'll unswear.What hath he said?'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.What? what?Lie--With her?With her, on her; what you will.Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, whenthey belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--Toconfess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to behanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.Nature would not invest herself in such shadowingpassion without some instruction. It is not wordsthat shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--Work on,My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!My lord, I say! Othello!How now, Cassio!What's the matter?My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.Rub him about the temples.No, forbear;The lethargy must have his quiet course:If not, he foams at mouth and by and byBreaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:Do you withdraw yourself a little while,He will recover straight: when he is gone,I would on great occasion speak with you.How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?Dost thou mock me?I mock you! no, by heaven.Would you would bear your fortune like a man!A horned man's a monster and a beast.There's many a beast then in a populous city,And many a civil monster.Did he confess it?Good sir, be a man;Think every bearded fellow that's but yokedMay draw with you: there's millions now aliveThat nightly lie in those unproper bedsWhich they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,To lip a wanton in a secure couch,And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.Stand you awhile apart;Confine yourself but in a patient list.Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--A passion most unsuiting such a man--Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,Bade him anon return and here speak with me;The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,That dwell in every region of his face;For I will make him tell the tale anew,Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and whenHe hath, and is again to cope your wife:I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,And nothing of a man.Dost thou hear, Iago?I will be found most cunning in my patience;But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.That's not amiss;But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,A housewife that by selling her desiresBuys herself bread and clothes: it is a creatureThat dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plagueTo beguile many and be beguiled by one:He, when he hears of her, cannot refrainFrom the excess of laughter. Here he comes:As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;And his unbookish jealousy must construePoor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?The worser that you give me the additionWhose want even kills me.Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,How quickly should you speed!Alas, poor caitiff!Look, how he laughs already!I never knew woman love man so.Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.Do you hear, Cassio?Now he importunes himTo tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.She gives it out that you shall marry hey:Do you intend it?Ha, ha, ha!Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear somecharity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.Ha, ha, ha!So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.Prithee, say true.I am a very villain else.Have you scored me? Well.This is the monkey's own giving out: she ispersuaded I will marry her, out of her own love andflattery, not out of my promise.Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.I was the other day talking on the sea-bank withcertain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gestureimports it.So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shallthrow it to.Well, I must leave her company.Before me! look, where she comes.'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.What do you mean by this haunting of me?Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did youmean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out thework?--A likely piece of work, that you should findit in your chamber, and not know who left it there!This is some minx's token, and I must take out thework? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoeveryou had it, I'll take out no work on't.How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an youwill not, come when you are next prepared for.After her, after her.'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.Will you sup there?'Faith, I intend so.Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fainspeak with you.Prithee, come; will you?Go to; say no more.[Advancing]  How shall I murder him, Iago?Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?O Iago!And did you see the handkerchief?Was that mine?Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes thefoolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and hehath given it his whore.I would have him nine years a-killing.A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!Nay, you must forget that.Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned tostone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, theworld hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie byan emperor's side and command him tasks.Nay, that's not your way.Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicatewith her needle: an admirable musician: O! shewill sing the savageness out of a bear: of so highand plenteous wit and invention:--She's the worse for all this.O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of sogentle a condition!Ay, too gentle.Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!If you are so fond over her iniquity, give herpatent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comesnear nobody.I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!O, 'tis foul in her.With mine officer!That's fouler.Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll notexpostulate with her, lest her body and beautyunprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, eventhe bed she hath contaminated.Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: youshall hear more by midnight.Excellent good.What trumpet is that same?Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis LodovicoCome from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.Save you, worthy general!With all my heart, sir.The duke and senators of Venice greet you.I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?I am very glad to see you, signiorWelcome to Cyprus.I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?Lives, sir.Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lordAn unkind breach: but you shall make all well.Are you sure of that?My lord?[Reads]  'This fail you not to do, as you will--'He did not call; he's busy in the paper.Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?A most unhappy one: I would do muchTo atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.Fire and brimstone!My lord?Are you wise?What, is he angry?May be the letter moved him;For, as I think, they do command him home,Deputing Cassio in his government.Trust me, I am glad on't.Indeed!My lord?I am glad to see you mad.Why, sweet Othello,--[Striking her]  Devil!I have not deserved this.My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:Make her amends; she weeps.O devil, devil!If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.Out of my sight!I will not stay to offend you.Truly, an obedient lady:I do beseech your lordship, call her back.Mistress!My lord?What would you with her, sir?Who, I, my lord?Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.Concerning this, sir,--O  well-painted passion!--I am commanded home. Get you away;I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,I do entreat that we may sup together:You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!Is this the noble Moor whom our full senateCall all in all sufficient? Is this the natureWhom passion could not shake? whose solid virtueThe shot of accident, nor dart of chance,Could neither graze nor pierce?He is much changed.Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?He's that he is: I may not breathe my censureWhat he might be: if what he might he is not,I would to heaven he were!What, strike his wife!'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knewThat stroke would prove the worst!Is it his use?Or did the letters work upon his blood,And new-create this fault?Alas, alas!It is not honesty in me to speakWhat I have seen and known. You shall observe him,And his own courses will denote him soThat I may save my speech: do but go after,And mark how he continues.I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
