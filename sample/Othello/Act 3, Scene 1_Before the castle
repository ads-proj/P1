Masters, play here; I will content your pains;Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,that they speak i' the nose thus?How, sir, how!Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?Ay, marry, are they, sir.O, thereby hangs a tail.Whereby hangs a tale, sir?Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.But, masters, here's money for you: and the generalso likes your music, that he desires you, for love'ssake, to make no more noise with it.Well, sir, we will not.If you have any music that may not be heard, to'tagain: but, as they say to hear music the generaldoes not greatly care.We have none such, sir.Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:go; vanish into air; away!Dost thou hear, my honest friend?No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor pieceof gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attendsthe general's wife be stirring, tell her there'sone Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:wilt thou do this?She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, Ishall seem to notify unto her.Do, good my friend.In happy time, Iago.You have not been a-bed, then?Why, no; the day had brokeBefore we parted. I have made bold, Iago,To send in to your wife: my suit to herIs, that she will to virtuous DesdemonaProcure me some access.I'll send her to you presently;And I'll devise a mean to draw the MoorOut of the way, that your converse and businessMay be more free.I humbly thank you for't.I never knewA Florentine more kind and honest.Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorryFor your displeasure; but all will sure be well.The general and his wife are talking of it;And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdomHe might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves youAnd needs no other suitor but his likingsTo take the safest occasion by the frontTo bring you in again.Yet, I beseech you,If you think fit, or that it may be done,Give me advantage of some brief discourseWith Desdemona alone.Pray you, come in;I will bestow you where you shall have timeTo speak your bosom freely.I am much bound to you.
