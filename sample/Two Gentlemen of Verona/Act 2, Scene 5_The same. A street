Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am notwelcome. I reckon this always, that a man is neverundone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to aplace till some certain shot be paid and the hostesssay 'Welcome!'Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with youpresently; where, for one shot of five pence, thoushalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, howdid thy master part with Madam Julia?Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted veryfairly in jest.But shall she marry him?No.How then? shall he marry her?No, neither.What, are they broken?No, they are both as whole as a fish.Why, then, how stands the matter with them?Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, itstands well with her.What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.What a block art thou, that thou canst not! Mystaff understands me.What thou sayest?Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,and my staff understands me.It stands under thee, indeed.Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.But tell me true, will't be a match?Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.The conclusion is then that it will.Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayestthou, that my master is become a notable lover?I never knew him otherwise.Than how?A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himselfin love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth thename of a Christian.Why?Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as togo to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?At thy service.
