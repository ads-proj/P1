Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was thatWherewith my brother held you in the cloister?'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.Why, what of him?He wonder'd that your lordshipWould suffer him to spend his youth at home,While other men, of slender reputation,Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;Some to discover islands far away;Some to the studious universities.For any or for all these exercises,He said that Proteus your son was meet,And did request me to importune youTo let him spend his time no more at home,Which would be great impeachment to his age,In having known no travel in his youth.Nor need'st thou much importune me to thatWhereon this month I have been hammering.I have consider'd well his loss of timeAnd how he cannot be a perfect man,Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:Experience is by industry achievedAnd perfected by the swift course of time.Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?I think your lordship is not ignorantHow his companion, youthful Valentine,Attends the emperor in his royal court.I know it well.'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.And be in eye of every exerciseWorthy his youth and nobleness of birth.I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,The execution of it shall make known.Even with the speediest expeditionI will dispatch him to the emperor's court.To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,With other gentlemen of good esteem,Are journeying to salute the emperorAnd to commend their service to his will.Good company; with them shall Proteus go:And, in good time! now will we break with him.Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,To seal our happiness with their consents!O heavenly Julia!How now! what letter are you reading there?May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or twoOf commendations sent from Valentine,Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.Lend me the letter; let me see what news.There is no news, my lord, but that he writesHow happily he lives, how well belovedAnd daily graced by the emperor;Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.And how stand you affected to his wish?As one relying on your lordship's willAnd not depending on his friendly wish.My will is something sorted with his wish.Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;For what I will, I will, and there an end.I am resolved that thou shalt spend some timeWith Valentinus in the emperor's court:What maintenance he from his friends receives,Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.To-morrow be in readiness to go:Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:Please you, deliberate a day or two.Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'dTo hasten on his expedition.Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,Lest he should take exceptions to my love;And with the vantage of mine own excuseHath he excepted most against my love.O, how this spring of love resemblethThe uncertain glory of an April day,Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,And by and by a cloud takes all away!Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'
