That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave'ssleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain seethem meet; that that same young Trojan ass, thatloves the whore there, might send that Greekishwhore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to thedissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.O' the t'other side, the policy of those craftyswearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten drycheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, isnot proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, inpolicy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog ofas bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajaxprouder than the cur Achilles, and will not armto-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaimbarbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,I would swim after.Thou dost miscall retire:I do not fly, but advantageous careWithdrew me from the odds of multitude:Have at thee!Hold thy whore, Grecian!--now for thy whore,Trojan!--now the sleeve, now the sleeve!What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?Art thou of blood and honour?No, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:a very filthy rogue.I do believe thee: live.God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but aplague break thy neck for frightening me! What'sbecome of the wenching rogues? I think they haveswallowed one another: I would laugh at thatmiracle: yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself.I'll seek them.
