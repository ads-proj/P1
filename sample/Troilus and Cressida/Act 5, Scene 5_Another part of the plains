Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid:Fellow, commend my service to her beauty;Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan,And am her knight by proof.I go, my lord.Renew, renew! The fierce PolydamasHath beat down Menon: bastard MargarelonHath Doreus prisoner,And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,Upon the pashed corses of the kingsEpistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,Patroclus ta'en or slain, and PalamedesSore hurt and bruised: the dreadful SagittaryAppals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,To reinforcement, or we perish all.Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles;And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.There is a thousand Hectors in the field:Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,And there they fly or die, like scaled scullsBefore the belching whale; then is he yonder,And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,Dexterity so obeying appetiteThat what he will he does, and does so muchThat proof is call'd impossibility.O, courage, courage, princes! great AchillesIs arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance:Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,Together with his mangled Myrmidons,That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friendAnd foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-dayMad and fantastic execution,Engaging and redeeming of himselfWith such a careless force and forceless careAs if that luck, in very spite of cunning,Bade him win all.Troilus! thou coward Troilus!Ay, there, there.So, so, we draw together.Where is this Hector?Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face;Know what it is to meet Achilles angry:Hector? where's Hector? I will none but Hector.
