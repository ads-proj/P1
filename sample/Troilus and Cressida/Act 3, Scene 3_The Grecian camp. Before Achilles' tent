Now, princes, for the service I have done you,The advantage of the time prompts me aloudTo call for recompense. Appear it to your mindThat, through the sight I bear in things to love,I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,From certain and possess'd conveniences,To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me allThat time, acquaintance, custom and conditionMade tame and most familiar to my nature,And here, to do you service, am becomeAs new into the world, strange, unacquainted:I do beseech you, as in way of taste,To give me now a little benefit,Out of those many register'd in promise,Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,I know, is such a wrest in their affairsThat their negotiations all must slack,Wanting his manage; and they will almostGive us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,And he shall buy my daughter; and her presenceShall quite strike off all service I have done,In most accepted pain.Let Diomedes bear him,And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall haveWhat he requests of us. Good Diomed,Furnish you fairly for this interchange:Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrowBe answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burdenWhich I am proud to bear.Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:Please it our general to pass strangely by him,As if he were forgot; and, princes all,Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question meWhy such unplausive eyes are bent on him:If so, I have derision medicinable,To use between your strangeness and his pride,Which his own will shall have desire to drink:It may be good: pride hath no other glassTo show itself but pride, for supple kneesFeed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.We'll execute your purpose, and put onA form of strangeness as we pass along:So do each lord, and either greet him not,Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him moreThan if not look'd on. I will lead the way.What, comes the general to speak with me?You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.What says Achilles? would he aught with us?Would you, my lord, aught with the general?No.Nothing, my lord.The better.Good day, good day.How do you? how do you?What, does the cuckold scorn me?How now, Patroclus!Good morrow, Ajax.Ha?Good morrow.Ay, and good next day too.What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?They pass by strangely: they were used to bendTo send their smiles before them to Achilles;To come as humbly as they used to creepTo holy altars.What, am I poor of late?'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,Must fall out with men too: what the declined isHe shall as soon read in the eyes of othersAs feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,And not a man, for being simply man,Hath any honour, but honour for those honoursThat are without him, as place, riches, favour,Prizes of accident as oft as merit:Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,Do one pluck down another and togetherDie in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoyAt ample point all that I did possess,Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find outSomething not worth in me such rich beholdingAs they have often given. Here is Ulysses;I'll interrupt his reading.How now Ulysses!Now, great Thetis' son!What are you reading?A strange fellow hereWrites me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,How much in having, or without or in,Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;As when his virtues shining upon othersHeat them and they retort that heat againTo the first giver.'This is not strange, Ulysses.The beauty that is borne here in the faceThe bearer knows not, but commends itselfTo others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposedSalutes each other with each other's form;For speculation turns not to itself,Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd thereWhere it may see itself. This is not strange at all.I do not strain at the position,--It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;Who, in his circumstance, expressly provesThat no man is the lord of any thing,Though in and of him there be much consisting,Till he communicate his parts to others:Nor doth he of himself know them for aughtTill he behold them form'd in the applauseWhere they're extended; who, like an arch,reverberatesThe voice again, or, like a gate of steelFronting the sun, receives and renders backHis figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;And apprehended here immediatelyThe unknown Ajax.Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there areMost abject in regard and dear in use!What things again most dear in the esteemAnd poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--An act that very chance doth throw upon him--Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,While some men leave to do!How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!How one man eats into another's pride,While pride is fasting in his wantonness!To see these Grecian lords!--why, even alreadyThey clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,As if his foot were on brave Hector's breastAnd great Troy shrieking.I do believe it; for they pass'd by meAs misers do by beggars, neither gave to meGood word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'dAs fast as they are made, forgot as soonAs done: perseverance, dear my lord,Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hangQuite out of fashion, like a rusty mailIn monumental mockery. Take the instant way;For honour travels in a strait so narrow,Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;For emulation hath a thousand sonsThat one by one pursue: if you give way,Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush byAnd leave you hindmost;Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;For time is like a fashionable hostThat slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,And farewell goes out sighing. O, let notvirtue seekRemuneration for the thing it was;For beauty, wit,High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,Love, friendship, charity, are subjects allTo envious and calumniating time.One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,Though they are made and moulded of things past,And give to dust that is a little giltMore laud than gilt o'er-dusted.The present eye praises the present object.Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;Since things in motion sooner catch the eyeThan what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,And still it might, and yet it may again,If thou wouldst not entomb thyself aliveAnd case thy reputation in thy tent;Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselvesAnd drave great Mars to faction.Of this my privacyI have strong reasons.But 'gainst your privacyThe reasons are more potent and heroical:'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in loveWith one of Priam's daughters.Ha! known!Is that a wonder?The providence that's in a watchful stateKnows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.There is a mystery--with whom relationDurst never meddle--in the soul of state;Which hath an operation more divineThan breath or pen can give expressure to:All the commerce that you have had with TroyAs perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;And better would it fit Achilles muchTo throw down Hector than Polyxena:But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:A woman impudent and mannish grownIs not more loathed than an effeminate manIn time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;They think my little stomach to the warAnd your great love to me restrains you thus:Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton CupidShall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,Be shook to air.Shall Ajax fight with Hector?Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.I see my reputation is at stakeMy fame is shrewdly gored.O, then, beware;Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:Omission to do what is necessarySeals a commission to a blank of danger;And danger, like an ague, subtly taintsEven then when we sit idly in the sun.Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire himTo invite the Trojan lords after the combatTo see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,An appetite that I am sick withal,To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,To talk with him and to behold his visage,Even to my full of view.A labour saved!A wonder!What?Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.How so?He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is soprophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that heraves in saying nothing.How can that be?Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a strideand a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath noarithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:bites his lip with a politic regard, as who shouldsay 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as firein a flint, which will not show without knocking.The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not hisneck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself invain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What thinkyou of this man that takes me for the general? He'sgrown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on bothsides, like a leather jerkin.Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes notanswering: speaking is for beggars; he wears histongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: letPatroclus make demands to me, you shall see thepageant of Ajax.To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire thevaliant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hectorto come unarmed to my tent, and to procuresafe-conduct for his person of the magnanimousand most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honouredcaptain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,et cetera. Do this.Jove bless great Ajax!Hum!I come from the worthy Achilles,--Ha!Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--Hum!And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.Agamemnon!Ay, my lord.Ha!What say you to't?God b' wi' you, with all my heart.Your answer, sir.If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it willgo one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for meere he has me.Your answer, sir.Fare you well, with all my heart.Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be inhim when Hector has knocked out his brains, I knownot; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apolloget his sinews to make catlings on.Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the morecapable creature.My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;And I myself see not the bottom of it.Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be atick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.
