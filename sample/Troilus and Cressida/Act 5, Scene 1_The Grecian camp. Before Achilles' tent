I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.Here comes Thersites.How now, thou core of envy!Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idolof idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.From whence, fragment?Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.Who keeps the tent now?The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk:thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseasesof the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,loads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, coldpalsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezinglungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and therivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and takeagain such preposterous discoveries!Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanestthou to curse thus?Do I curse thee?Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoresonindistinguishable cur, no.No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idleimmaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenetflap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal'spurse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pesteredwith such waterflies, diminutives of nature!Out, gall!Finch-egg!My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quiteFrom my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,A token from her daughter, my fair love,Both taxing me and gaging me to keepAn oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:This night in banqueting must all be spent.Away, Patroclus!With too much blood and too little brain, these twomay run mad; but, if with too much brain and toolittle blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and onethat loves quails; but he has not so much brain asearwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiterthere, his brother, the bull,--the primitive statue,and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thriftyshoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother'sleg,--to what form but that he is, should wit lardedwith malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?To an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: toan ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be adog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, anowl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I wouldnot care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspireagainst destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if Iwere not Thersites; for I care not to be the louseof a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!spirits and fires!We go wrong, we go wrong.No, yonder 'tis;There, where we see the lights.I trouble you.No, not a whit.Here comes himself to guide you.Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.Good night, my lord.Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,sweet sewer.Good night and welcome, both at once, to thoseThat go or tarry.Good night.Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,Keep Hector company an hour or two.I cannot, lord; I have important business,The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.Give me your hand.[Aside to TROILUS]  Follow his torch; he goes toCalchas' tent:I'll keep you company.Sweet sir, you honour me.And so, good night.Come, come, enter my tent.That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a mostunjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leersthan I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spendhis mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; itis prodigious, there will come some change; the sunborrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps hisword. I will rather leave to see Hector, thannot to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojandrab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'llafter. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!
