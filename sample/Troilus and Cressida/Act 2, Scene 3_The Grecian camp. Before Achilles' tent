How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth ofthy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? Hebeats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn toconjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue ofmy spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, arare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these twoundermine it, the walls will stand till they fall ofthemselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thycaduceus, if ye take not that little, little lessthan little wit from them that they have! whichshort-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundantscarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a flyfrom a spider, without drawing their massy irons andcutting the web. After this, the vengeance on thewhole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,methinks, is the curse dependent on those that warfor a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envysay Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thouwouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: butit is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The commoncurse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine ingreat revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, anddiscipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thydirection till thy death! then if she that lays theeout says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn andsworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.Amen. Where's Achilles?What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?Ay: the heavens hear me!Who's there?Thersites, my lord.Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, mydigestion, why hast thou not served thyself in tomy table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,what's Achilles?Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,what's thyself?Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,what art thou?Thou mayst tell that knowest.O, tell, tell.I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commandsAchilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'knower, and Patroclus is a fool.You rascal!Peace, fool! I have not done.He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersitesis a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.Derive this; come.Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, andPatroclus is a fool positive.Why am I a fool?Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thouart. Look you, who comes here?Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.Come in with me, Thersites.Here is such patchery, such juggling and suchknavery! all the argument is a cuckold and awhore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factionsand bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo onthe subject! and war and lechery confound all!Where is Achilles?Within his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.Let it be known to him that we are here.He shent our messengers; and we lay byOur appertainments, visiting of him:Let him be told so; lest perchance he thinkWe dare not move the question of our place,Or know not what we are.I shall say so to him.We saw him at the opening of his tent:He is not sick.Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call itmelancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by myhead, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us thecause. A word, my lord.What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.Who, Thersites?He.Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.No, you see, he is his argument that has hisargument, Achilles.All the better; their fraction is more our wish thantheir faction: but it was a strong composure a foolcould disunite.The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easilyuntie. Here comes Patroclus.No Achilles with him.The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,If any thing more than your sport and pleasureDid move your greatness and this noble stateTo call upon him; he hopes it is no otherBut for your health and your digestion sake,And after-dinner's breath.Hear you, Patroclus:We are too well acquainted with these answers:But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,Cannot outfly our apprehensions.Much attribute he hath, and much the reasonWhy we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,Not virtuously on his own part beheld,Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,If you do say we think him over-proudAnd under-honest, in self-assumption greaterThan in the note of judgment; and worthierthan himselfHere tend the savage strangeness he puts on,Disguise the holy strength of their command,And underwrite in an observing kindHis humorous predominance; yea, watchHis pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as ifThe passage and whole carriage of this actionRode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,That if he overhold his price so much,We'll none of him; but let him, like an engineNot portable, lie under this report:'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:A stirring dwarf we do allowance giveBefore a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.I shall; and bring his answer presently.In second voice we'll not be satisfied;We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.What is he more than another?No more than what he thinks he is.Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself abetter man than I am?No question.Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, aswise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogethermore tractable.Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? Iknow not what pride is.Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues thefairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride ishis own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devoursthe deed in the praise.I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.What's his excuse?He doth rely on none,But carries on the stream of his disposeWithout observance or respect of any,In will peculiar and in self-admission.Why will he not upon our fair requestUntent his person and share the air with us?Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,And speaks not to himself but with a prideThat quarrels at self-breath: imagined worthHolds in his blood such swoln and hot discourseThat 'twixt his mental and his active partsKingdom'd Achilles in commotion ragesAnd batters down himself: what should I say?He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of itCry 'No recovery.'Let Ajax go to him.Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:'Tis said he holds you well, and will be ledAt your request a little from himself.O Agamemnon, let it not be so!We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makesWhen they go from Achilles: shall the proud lordThat bastes his arrogance with his own seamAnd never suffers matter of the worldEnter his thoughts, save such as do revolveAnd ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'dOf that we hold an idol more than he?No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lordMust not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,As amply titled as Achilles is,By going to Achilles:That were to enlard his fat already prideAnd add more coals to Cancer when he burnsWith entertaining great Hyperion.This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'[Aside to DIOMEDES]  O, this is well; he rubs thevein of him.[Aside to NESTOR]  And how his silence drinks upthis applause!If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.O, no, you shall not go.An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:Let me go to him.Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.A paltry, insolent fellow!How he describes himself!Can he not be sociable?The raven chides blackness.I'll let his humours blood.He will be the physician that should be the patient.An all men were o' my mind,--Wit would be out of fashion.A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:shall pride carry it?An 'twould, you'ld carry half.A' would have ten shares.I will knead him; I'll make him supple.He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.[To AGAMEMNON]  My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.Our noble general, do not do so.You must prepare to fight without Achilles.Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;I will be silent.Wherefore should you so?He is not emulous, as Achilles is.Know the whole world, he is as valiant.A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!Would he were a Trojan!What a vice were it in Ajax now,--If he were proud,--Or covetous of praise,--Ay, or surly borne,--Or strange, or self-affected!Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of natureThrice famed, beyond all erudition:But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,Let Mars divide eternity in twain,And give him half: and, for thy vigour,Bull-bearing Milo his addition yieldTo sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confinesThy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;Instructed by the antiquary times,He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:Put pardon, father Nestor, were your daysAs green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,You should not have the eminence of him,But be as Ajax.Shall I call you father?Ay, my good son.Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.There is no tarrying here; the hart AchillesKeeps thicket. Please it our great generalTo call together all his state of war;Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrowWe must with all our main of power stand fast:And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
