Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed briefWith winged haste to the lord marshal;This to my cousin Scroop, and all the restTo whom they are directed. If you knewHow much they do to import, you would make haste.My good lord,I guess their tenor.Like enough you do.To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a dayWherein the fortune of ten thousand menMust bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,As I am truly given to understand,The king with mighty and quick-raised powerMeets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,What with the sickness of Northumberland,Whose power was in the first proportion,And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,Who with them was a rated sinew tooAnd comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,I fear the power of Percy is too weakTo wage an instant trial with the king.Why, my good lord, you need not fear;There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.No, Mortimer is not there.But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,And there is my Lord of Worcester and a headOf gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.And so there is: but yet the king hath drawnThe special head of all the land together:The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;And moe corrivals and dear menOf estimation and command in arms.Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the kingDismiss his power, he means to visit us,For he hath heard of our confederacy,And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:Therefore make haste. I must go write againTo other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.
