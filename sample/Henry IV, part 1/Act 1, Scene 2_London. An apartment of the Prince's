Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sackand unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping uponbenches after noon, that thou hast forgotten todemand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.What a devil hast thou to do with the time of theday? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutescapons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials thesigns of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himselfa fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see noreason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demandthe time of the day.Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that takepurses go by the moon and the seven stars, and notby Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, Godsave thy grace,--majesty I should say, for gracethou wilt have none,--What, none?No, by my troth, not so much as will serve toprologue to an egg and butter.Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let notus that are squires of the night's body be calledthieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana'sforesters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of themoon; and let men say we be men of good government,being governed, as the sea is, by our noble andchaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for thefortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb andflow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of goldmost resolutely snatched on Monday night and mostdissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got withswearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladderand by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not myhostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. Andis not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips andthy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with abuff jerkin?Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many atime and oft.Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;and where it would not, I have used my credit.Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparentthat thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweetwag, shall there be gallows standing in England whenthou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it iswith the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Donot thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.No; thou shalt.Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt havethe hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with myhumour as well as waiting in the court, I can tellyou.For obtaining of suits?Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangmanhath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholyas a gib cat or a lugged bear.Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy ofMoor-ditch?Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeedthe most comparative, rascalliest, sweet youngprince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no morewith vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where acommodity of good names were to be bought. An oldlord of the council rated me the other day in thestreet about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yethe talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; andyet he talked wisely, and in the street too.Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in thestreets, and no man regards it.O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed ableto corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm uponme, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knewthee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a manshould speak truly, little better than one of thewicked. I must give over this life, and I will giveit over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:I'll be damned for never a king's son inChristendom.Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an Ido not, call me villain and baffle me.I see a good amendment of life in thee; from prayingto purse-taking.Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for aman to labour in his vocation.Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set amatch. O, if men were to be saved by merit, whathole in hell were hot enough for him? This is themost omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' toa true man.Good morrow, Ned.Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! howagrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thousoldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeiraand a cold capon's leg?Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall havehis bargain; for he was never yet a breaker ofproverbs: he will give the devil his due.Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by fouro'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims goingto Canterbury with rich offerings, and tradersriding to London with fat purses: I have vizardsfor you all; you have horses for yourselves:Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespokesupper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do itas secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuffyour purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarryat home and be hanged.Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,I'll hang you for going.You will, chops?Hal, wilt thou make one?Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.There's neither honesty, manhood, nor goodfellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the bloodroyal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.Why, that's well said.Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.I care not.Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:I will lay him down such reasons for this adventurethat he shall go.Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and himthe ears of profiting, that what thou speakest maymove and what he hears may be believed, that thetrue prince may, for recreation sake, prove a falsethief; for the poor abuses of the time wantcountenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with usto-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannotmanage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshillshall rob those men that we have already waylaid:yourself and I will not be there; and when theyhave the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cutthis head off from my shoulders.How shall we part with them in setting forth?Why, we will set forth before or after them, andappoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is atour pleasure to fail, and then will they adventureupon the exploit themselves; which they shall haveno sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by ourhorses, by our habits and by every otherappointment, to be ourselves.Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie themin the wood; our vizards we will change after weleave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckramfor the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.Well, for two of them, I know them to be astrue-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for thethird, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'llforswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, theincomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue willtell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, atleast, he fought with; what wards, what blows, whatextremities he endured; and in the reproof of thislies the jest.Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all thingsnecessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;there I'll sup. Farewell.Farewell, my lord.I know you all, and will awhile upholdThe unyoked humour of your idleness:Yet herein will I imitate the sun,Who doth permit the base contagious cloudsTo smother up his beauty from the world,That, when he please again to be himself,Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,By breaking through the foul and ugly mistsOf vapours that did seem to strangle him.If all the year were playing holidays,To sport would be as tedious as to work;But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.So, when this loose behavior I throw offAnd pay the debt I never promised,By how much better than my word I am,By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;And like bright metal on a sullen ground,My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,Shall show more goodly and attract more eyesThan that which hath no foil to set it off.I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;Redeeming time when men think least I will.
