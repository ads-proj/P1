If we be not relieved within this hour,We must return to the court of guard: the nightIs shiny; and they say we shall embattleBy the second hour i' the morn.This last day wasA shrewd one to's.O, bear me witness, night,--What man is this?Stand close, and list him.Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,When men revolted shall upon recordBear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus didBefore thy face repent!Enobarbus!Peace!Hark further.O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,That life, a very rebel to my will,May hang no longer on me: throw my heartAgainst the flint and hardness of my fault:Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,Nobler than my revolt is infamous,Forgive me in thine own particular;But let the world rank me in registerA master-leaver and a fugitive:O Antony! O Antony!Let's speak To him.Let's hear him, for the things he speaksMay concern Caesar.Let's do so. But he sleeps.Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as hisWas never yet for sleep.Go we to him.Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.Hear you, sir?The hand of death hath raught him.Hark! the drumsDemurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear himTo the court of guard; he is of note: our hourIs fully out.Come on, then;He may recover yet.
