Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:I am so lated in the world, that IHave lost my way for ever: I have a shipLaden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,And make your peace with Caesar.Fly! not we.I have fled myself; and have instructed cowardsTo run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;I have myself resolved upon a courseWhich has no need of you; be gone:My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,I follow'd that I blush to look upon:My very hairs do mutiny; for the whiteReprove the brown for rashness, and they themFor fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shallHave letters from me to some friends that willSweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,Nor make replies of loathness: take the hintWhich my despair proclaims; let that be leftWhich leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:I will possess you of that ship and treasure.Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.Do, most dear queen.Do! why: what else?Let me sit down. O Juno!No, no, no, no, no.See you here, sir?O fie, fie, fie!Madam!Madam, O good empress!Sir, sir,--Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi keptHis sword e'en like a dancer; while I struckThe lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas IThat the mad Brutus ended: he aloneDealt on lieutenantry, and no practise hadIn the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.Ah, stand by.The queen, my lord, the queen.Go to him, madam, speak to him:He is unqualitied with very shame.Well then, sustain him: O!Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:Her head's declined, and death will seize her, butYour comfort makes the rescue.I have offended reputation,A most unnoble swerving.Sir, the queen.O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,How I convey my shame out of thine eyesBy looking back what I have left behind'Stroy'd in dishonour.O my lord, my lord,Forgive my fearful sails! I little thoughtYou would have follow'd.Egypt, thou knew'st too wellMy heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spiritThy full supremacy thou knew'st, and thatThy beck might from the bidding of the godsCommand me.O, my pardon!Now I mustTo the young man send humble treaties, dodgeAnd palter in the shifts of lowness; whoWith half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,Making and marring fortunes. You did knowHow much you were my conqueror; and thatMy sword, made weak by my affection, wouldObey it on all cause.Pardon, pardon!Fall not a tear, I say; one of them ratesAll that is won and lost: give me a kiss;Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knowsWe scorn her most when most she offers blows.
