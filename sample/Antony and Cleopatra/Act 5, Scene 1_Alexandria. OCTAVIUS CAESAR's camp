Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;Being so frustrate, tell him he mocksThe pauses that he makes.Caesar, I shall.Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darestAppear thus to us?I am call'd Dercetas;Mark Antony I served, who best was worthyBest to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,He was my master; and I wore my lifeTo spend upon his haters. If thou pleaseTo take me to thee, as I was to himI'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,I yield thee up my life.What is't thou say'st?I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.The breaking of so great a thing should makeA greater crack: the round worldShould have shook lions into civil streets,And citizens to their dens: the death of AntonyIs not a single doom; in the name layA moiety of the world.He is dead, Caesar:Not by a public minister of justice,Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,Which writ his honour in the acts it did,Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,Splitted the heart. This is his sword;I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'dWith his most noble blood.Look you sad, friends?The gods rebuke me, but it is tidingsTo wash the eyes of kings.And strange it is,That nature must compel us to lamentOur most persisted deeds.His taints and honoursWaged equal with him.A rarer spirit neverDid steer humanity: but you, gods, will give usSome faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.When such a spacious mirror's set before him,He needs must see himself.O Antony!I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lanceDiseases in our bodies: I must perforceHave shown to thee such a declining day,Or look on thine; we could not stall togetherIn the whole world: but yet let me lament,With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,That thou, my brother, my competitorIn top of all design, my mate in empire,Friend and companion in the front of war,The arm of mine own body, and the heartWhere mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,Unreconciliable, should divideOur equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--But I will tell you at some meeter season:The business of this man looks out of him;We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,Confined in all she has, her monument,Of thy intents desires instruction,That she preparedly may frame herselfTo the way she's forced to.Bid her have good heart:She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,How honourable and how kindly weDetermine for her; for Caesar cannot liveTo be ungentle.So the gods preserve thee!Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,We purpose her no shame: give her what comfortsThe quality of her passion shall require,Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal strokeShe do defeat us; for her life in RomeWould be eternal in our triumph: go,And with your speediest bring us what she says,And how you find of her.Caesar, I shall.Gallus, go you along.Where's Dolabella,To second Proculeius?Dolabella!Let him alone, for I remember nowHow he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.Go with me to my tent; where you shall seeHow hardly I was drawn into this war;How calm and gentle I proceeded stillIn all my writings: go with me, and seeWhat I can show in this.
