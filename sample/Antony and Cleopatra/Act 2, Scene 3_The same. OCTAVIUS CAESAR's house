The world and my great office will sometimesDivide me from your bosom.All which timeBefore the gods my knee shall bow my prayersTo them for you.Good night, sir. My Octavia,Read not my blemishes in the world's report:I have not kept my square; but that to comeShall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.Good night, sir.Good night.Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!If you can, your reason?I see it inMy motion, have it not in my tongue: but yetHie you to Egypt again.Say to me,Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?Caesar's.Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, isNoble, courageous high, unmatchable,Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angelBecomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: thereforeMake space enough between you.Speak this no more.To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.If thou dost play with him at any game,Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,When he shines by: I say again, thy spiritIs all afraid to govern thee near him;But, he away, 'tis noble.Get thee gone:Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;And in our sports my better cunning faintsUnder his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;His cocks do win the battle still of mine,When it is all to nought; and his quails everBeat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:And though I make this marriage for my peace,I' the east my pleasure lies.O, come, Ventidius,You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;Follow me, and receive't.
