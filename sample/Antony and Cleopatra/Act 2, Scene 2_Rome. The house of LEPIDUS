Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,And shall become you well, to entreat your captainTo soft and gentle speech.I shall entreat himTo answer like himself: if Caesar move him,Let Antony look over Caesar's headAnd speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,I would not shave't to-day.'Tis not a timeFor private stomaching.Every timeServes for the matter that is then born in't.But small to greater matters must give way.Not if the small come first.Your speech is passion:But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comesThe noble Antony.And yonder, Caesar.If we compose well here, to Parthia:Hark, Ventidius.I do not know,Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.Noble friends,That which combined us was most great, and let notA leaner action rend us. What's amiss,May it be gently heard: when we debateOur trivial difference loud, we do commitMurder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,The rather, for I earnestly beseech,Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,Nor curstness grow to the matter.'Tis spoken well.Were we before our armies, and to fight.I should do thus.Welcome to Rome.Thank you.Sit.Sit, sir.Nay, then.I learn, you take things ill which are not so,Or being, concern you not.I must be laugh'd at,If, or for nothing or a little, IShould say myself offended, and with youChiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I shouldOnce name you derogately, when to sound your nameIt not concern'd me.My being in Egypt, Caesar,What was't to you?No more than my residing here at RomeMight be to you in Egypt: yet, if you thereDid practise on my state, your being in EgyptMight be my question.How intend you, practised?You may be pleased to catch at mine intentBy what did here befal me. Your wife and brotherMade wars upon me; and their contestationWas theme for you, you were the word of war.You do mistake your business; my brother neverDid urge me in his act: I did inquire it;And have my learning from some true reports,That drew their swords with you. Did he not ratherDiscredit my authority with yours;And make the wars alike against my stomach,Having alike your cause? Of this my lettersBefore did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,As matter whole you have not to make it with,It must not be with this.You praise yourselfBy laying defects of judgment to me; butYou patch'd up your excuses.Not so, not so;I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,Very necessity of this thought, that I,Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,Could not with graceful eyes attend those warsWhich fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,I would you had her spirit in such another:The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffleYou may pace easy, but not such a wife.Would we had all such wives, that the men might goto wars with the women!So much uncurbable, her garboils, CaesarMade out of her impatience, which not wantedShrewdness of policy too, I grieving grantDid you too much disquiet: for that you mustBut say, I could not help it.I wrote to youWhen rioting in Alexandria; youDid pocket up my letters, and with tauntsDid gibe my missive out of audience.Sir,He fell upon me ere admitted: thenThree kings I had newly feasted, and did wantOf what I was i' the morning: but next dayI told him of myself; which was as muchAs to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellowBe nothing of our strife; if we contend,Out of our question wipe him.You have brokenThe article of your oath; which you shall neverHave tongue to charge me with.Soft, Caesar!No,Lepidus, let him speak:The honour is sacred which he talks on now,Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;The article of my oath.To lend me arms and aid when I required them;The which you both denied.Neglected, rather;And then when poison'd hours had bound me upFrom mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honestyShall not make poor my greatness, nor my powerWork without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;For which myself, the ignorant motive, doSo far ask pardon as befits mine honourTo stoop in such a case.'Tis noble spoken.If it might please you, to enforce no furtherThe griefs between ye: to forget them quiteWere to remember that the present needSpeaks to atone you.Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.Or, if you borrow one another's love for theinstant, you may, when you hear no more words ofPompey, return it again: you shall have time towrangle in when you have nothing else to do.Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.Go to, then; your considerate stone.I do not much dislike the matter, butThe manner of his speech; for't cannot beWe shall remain in friendship, our conditionsSo differing in their acts. Yet if I knewWhat hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edgeO' the world I would pursue it.Give me leave, Caesar,--Speak, Agrippa.Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,Admired Octavia: great Mark AntonyIs now a widower.Say not so, Agrippa:If Cleopatra heard you, your reproofWere well deserved of rashness.I am not married, Caesar: let me hearAgrippa further speak.To hold you in perpetual amity,To make you brothers, and to knit your heartsWith an unslipping  knot, take AntonyOctavia to his wife; whose beauty claimsNo worse a husband than the best of men;Whose virtue and whose general graces speakThat which none else can utter. By this marriage,All little jealousies, which now seem great,And all great fears, which now import their dangers,Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,Where now half tales be truths: her love to bothWould, each to other and all loves to both,Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,By duty ruminated.Will Caesar speak?Not till he hears how Antony is touch'dWith what is spoke already.What power is in Agrippa,If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'To make this good?The power of Caesar, andHis power unto Octavia.May I neverTo this good purpose, that so fairly shows,Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:Further this act of grace: and from this hourThe heart of brothers govern in our lovesAnd sway our great designs!There is my hand.A sister I bequeath you, whom no brotherDid ever love so dearly: let her liveTo join our kingdoms and our hearts; and neverFly off our loves again!Happily, amen!I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;For he hath laid strange courtesies and greatOf late upon me: I must thank him only,Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;At heel of that, defy him.Time calls upon's:Of us must Pompey presently be sought,Or else he seeks out us.Where lies he?About the mount Misenum.What is his strength by land?Great and increasing: but by seaHe is an absolute master.So is the fame.Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch weThe business we have talk'd of.With most gladness:And do invite you to my sister's view,Whither straight I'll lead you.Let us, Lepidus,Not lack your company.Noble Antony,Not sickness should detain me.Welcome from Egypt, sir.Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! Myhonourable friend, Agrippa!Good Enobarbus!We have cause to be glad that matters are so welldigested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, andmade the night light with drinking.Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, andbut twelve persons there; is this true?This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much moremonstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square toher.When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed uphis heart, upon the river of Cydnus.There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devisedwell for her.I will tell you.The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;Purple the sails, and so perfumed thatThe winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and madeThe water which they beat to follow faster,As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,It beggar'd all description: she did lieIn her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--O'er-picturing that Venus where we seeThe fancy outwork nature: on each side herStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seemTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,And what they undid did.O, rare for Antony!Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,And made their bends adornings: at the helmA seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackleSwell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,That yarely frame the office. From the bargeA strange invisible perfume hits the senseOf the adjacent wharfs. The city castHer people out upon her; and Antony,Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,And made a gap in nature.Rare Egyptian!Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,Invited her to supper: she replied,It should be better he became her guest;Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,And for his ordinary pays his heartFor what his eyes eat only.Royal wench!She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.I saw her onceHop forty paces through the public street;And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,That she did make defect perfection,And, breathless, power breathe forth.Now Antony must leave her utterly.Never; he will not:Age cannot wither her, nor custom staleHer infinite variety: other women cloyThe appetites they feed: but she makes hungryWhere most she satisfies; for vilest thingsBecome themselves in her: that the holy priestsBless her when she is riggish.If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settleThe heart of Antony, Octavia isA blessed lottery to him.Let us go.Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guestWhilst you abide here.Humbly, sir, I thank you.
