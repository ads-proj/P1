Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayerthat you praised so to the queen? O, that I knewthis husband, which, you say, must charge his hornswith garlands!Soothsayer!Your will?Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?In nature's infinite book of secrecyA little I can read.Show him your hand.Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enoughCleopatra's health to drink.Good sir, give me good fortune.I make not, but foresee.Pray, then, foresee me one.You shall be yet far fairer than you are.He means in flesh.No, you shall paint when you are old.Wrinkles forbid!Vex not his prescience; be attentive.Hush!You shall be more beloving than beloved.I had rather heat my liver with drinking.Nay, hear him.Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be marriedto three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewrymay do homage: find me to marry me with OctaviusCaesar, and companion me with my mistress.You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.O excellent! I love long life better than figs.You have seen and proved a fairer former fortuneThan that which is to approach.Then belike my children shall have no names:prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?If every of your wishes had a womb.And fertile every wish, a million.Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.Nay, come, tell Iras hers.We'll know all our fortunes.Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shallbe--drunk to bed.There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitfulprognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,tell her but a worky-day fortune.Your fortunes are alike.But how, but how? give me particulars.I have said.Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better thanI, where would you choose it?Not in my husband's nose.Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a womanthat cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and lether die too, and give him a worse! and let worstfollow worse, till the worst of all follow himlaughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! GoodIsis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me amatter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome manloose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold afoul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keepdecorum, and fortune him accordingly!Amen.Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me acuckold, they would make themselves whores, butthey'ld do't!Hush! here comes Antony.Not he; the queen.Saw you my lord?No, lady.Was he not here?No, madam.He was disposed to mirth; but on the suddenA Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!Madam?Seek him, and bring him hither.Where's Alexas?Here, at your service. My lord approaches.We will not look upon him: go with us.Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.Against my brother Lucius?Ay:But soon that war had end, and the time's stateMade friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,Upon the first encounter, drave them.Well, what worst?The nature of bad news infects the teller.When it concerns the fool or coward. On:Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,I hear him as he flatter'd.Labienus--This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,Extended Asia from Euphrates;His conquering banner shook from SyriaTo Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--Antony, thou wouldst say,--O, my lord!Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faultsWith such full licence as both truth and maliceHave power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told usIs as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.At your noble pleasure.From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?He stays upon your will.Let him appear.These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,Or lose myself in dotage.What are you?Fulvia thy wife is dead.Where died she?In Sicyon:Her length of sickness, with what else more seriousImporteth thee to know, this bears.Forbear me.There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:What our contempt doth often hurl from us,We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,By revolution lowering, does becomeThe opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.I must from this enchanting queen break off:Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!What's your pleasure, sir?I must with haste from hence.Why, then, we kill all our women:we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;if they suffer our departure, death's the word.I must be gone.Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it werepity to cast them away for nothing; though, betweenthem and a great cause, they should be esteemednothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise ofthis, dies instantly; I have seen her die twentytimes upon far poorer moment: I do think there ismettle in death, which commits some loving act uponher, she hath such a celerity in dying.She is cunning past man's thought.Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing butthe finest part of pure love: we cannot call herwinds and waters sighs and tears; they are greaterstorms and tempests than almanacs can report: thiscannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes ashower of rain as well as Jove.Would I had never seen her.O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful pieceof work; which not to have been blest withal wouldhave discredited your travel.Fulvia is dead.Sir?Fulvia is dead.Fulvia!Dead.Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. Whenit pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a manfrom him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;comforting therein, that when old robes are wornout, there are members to make new. If there wereno more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,and the case to be lamented: this grief is crownedwith consolation; your old smock brings forth a newpetticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onionthat should water this sorrow.The business she hath broached in the stateCannot endure my absence.And the business you have broached here cannot bewithout you; especially that of Cleopatra's, whichwholly depends on your abode.No more light answers. Let our officersHave notice what we purpose. I shall breakThe cause of our expedience to the queen,And get her leave to part. For not aloneThe death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,Do strongly speak to us; but the letters tooOf many our contriving friends in RomePetition us at home: Sextus PompeiusHath given the dare to Caesar, and commandsThe empire of the sea: our slippery people,Whose love is never link'd to the deserverTill his deserts are past, begin to throwPompey the Great and all his dignitiesUpon his son; who, high in name and power,Higher than both in blood and life, stands upFor the main soldier: whose quality, going on,The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,To such whose place is under us, requiresOur quick remove from hence.I shall do't.
