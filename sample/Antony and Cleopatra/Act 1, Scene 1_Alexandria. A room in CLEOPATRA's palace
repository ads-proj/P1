Nay, but this dotage of our general'sO'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,That o'er the files and musters of the warHave glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,The office and devotion of their viewUpon a tawny front: his captain's heart,Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burstThe buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,And is become the bellows and the fanTo cool a gipsy's lust.Look, where they come:Take but good note, and you shall see in him.The triple pillar of the world transform'dInto a strumpet's fool: behold and see.If it be love indeed, tell me how much.There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.News, my good lord, from Rome.Grates me: the sum.Nay, hear them, Antony:Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knowsIf the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sentHis powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'How, my love!Perchance! nay, and most like:You must not stay here longer, your dismissionIs come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thineIs Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shameWhen shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide archOf the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alikeFeeds beast as man: the nobleness of lifeIs to do thus; when such a mutual pairAnd such a twain can do't, in which I bind,On pain of punishment, the world to weetWe stand up peerless.Excellent falsehood!Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?I'll seem the fool I am not; AntonyWill be himself.But stirr'd by Cleopatra.Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:There's not a minute of our lives should stretchWithout some pleasure now. What sport tonight?Hear the ambassadors.Fie, wrangling queen!Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,To weep; whose every passion fully strivesTo make itself, in thee, fair and admired!No messenger, but thine; and all aloneTo-night we'll wander through the streets and noteThe qualities of people. Come, my queen;Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,He comes too short of that great propertyWhich still should go with Antony.I am full sorryThat he approves the common liar, whoThus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hopeOf better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
