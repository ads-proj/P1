What shall we do, Enobarbus?Think, and die.Is Antony or we in fault for this?Antony only, that would make his willLord of his reason. What though you fledFrom that great face of war, whose several rangesFrighted each other? why should he follow?The itch of his affection should not thenHave nick'd his captainship; at such a point,When half to half the world opposed, he beingThe meered question: 'twas a shame no lessThan was his loss, to course your flying flags,And leave his navy gazing.Prithee, peace.Is that his answer?Ay, my lord.The queen shall then have courtesy, so sheWill yield us up.He says so.Let her know't.To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,And he will fill thy wishes to the brimWith principalities.That head, my lord?To him again: tell him he wears the roseOf youth upon him; from which the world should noteSomething particular: his coin, ships, legions,May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevailUnder the service of a child as soonAs i' the command of Caesar: I dare him thereforeTo lay his gay comparisons apart,And answer me declined, sword against sword,Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.[Aside]  Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar willUnstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,Against a sworder! I see men's judgments areA parcel of their fortunes; and things outwardDo draw the inward quality after them,To suffer all alike. That he should dream,Knowing all measures, the full Caesar willAnswer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subduedHis judgment too.A messenger from CAESAR.What, no more ceremony? See, my women!Against the blown rose may they stop their noseThat kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.[Aside]  Mine honesty and I begin to square.The loyalty well held to fools does makeOur faith mere folly: yet he that can endureTo follow with allegiance a fall'n lordDoes conquer him that did his master conquerAnd earns a place i' the story.Caesar's will?Hear it apart.None but friends: say boldly.So, haply, are they friends to Antony.He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our masterWill leap to be his friend: for us, you know,Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.So.Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,Further than he is Caesar.Go on: right royal.He knows that you embrace not AntonyAs you did love, but as you fear'd him.O!The scars upon your honour, therefore, heDoes pity, as constrained blemishes,Not as deserved.He is a god, and knowsWhat is most right: mine honour was not yielded,But conquer'd merely.[Aside]             To be sure of that,I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,That we must leave thee to thy sinking, forThy dearest quit thee.Shall I say to CaesarWhat you require of him? for he partly begsTo be desired to give. It much would please him,That of his fortunes you should make a staffTo lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,To hear from me you had left Antony,And put yourself under his shrowd,The universal landlord.What's your name?My name is Thyreus.Most kind messenger,Say to great Caesar this: in deputationI kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am promptTo lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hearThe doom of Egypt.'Tis your noblest course.Wisdom and fortune combating together,If that the former dare but what it can,No chance may shake it. Give me grace to layMy duty on your hand.Your Caesar's father oft,When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,As it rain'd kisses.Favours, by Jove that thunders!What art thou, fellow?One that but performsThe bidding of the fullest man, and worthiestTo have command obey'd.[Aside]               You will be whipp'd.Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, godsand devils!Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I amAntony yet.Take hence this Jack, and whip him.[Aside]  'Tis better playing with a lion's whelpThan with an old one dying.Moon and stars!Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributariesThat do acknowledge Caesar, should I find themSo saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.Mark Antony!Tug him away: being whipp'd,Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shallBear us an errand to him.You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,Forborne the getting of a lawful race,And by a gem of women, to be abusedBy one that looks on feeders?Good my lord,--You have been a boggler ever:But when we in our viciousness grow hard--O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make usAdore our errors; laugh at's, while we strutTo our confusion.O, is't come to this?I found you as a morsel cold uponDead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragmentOf Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you haveLuxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,Though you can guess what temperance should be,You know not what it is.Wherefore is this?To let a fellow that will take rewardsAnd say 'God quit you!' be familiar withMy playfellow, your hand; this kingly sealAnd plighter of high hearts! O, that I wereUpon the hill of Basan, to outroarThe horned herd! for I have savage cause;And to proclaim it civilly, were likeA halter'd neck which does the hangman thankFor being yare about him.Is he whipp'd?Soundly, my lord.Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?He did ask favour.If that thy father live, let him repentThou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorryTo follow Caesar in his triumph, sinceThou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforthThe white hand of a lady fever thee,Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou sayHe makes me angry with him; for he seemsProud and disdainful, harping on what I am,Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,When my good stars, that were my former guides,Have empty left their orbs, and shot their firesInto the abysm of hell. If he mislikeMy speech and what is done, tell him he hasHipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whomHe may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:Hence with thy stripes, begone!Have you done yet?Alack, our terrene moonIs now eclipsed; and it portends aloneThe fall of Antony!I must stay his time.To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyesWith one that ties his points?Not know me yet?Cold-hearted toward me?Ah, dear, if I be so,From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,And poison it in the source; and the first stoneDrop in my neck: as it determines, soDissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!Till by degrees the memory of my womb,Together with my brave Egyptians all,By the discandying of this pelleted storm,Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of NileHave buried them for prey!I am satisfied.Caesar sits down in Alexandria; whereI will oppose his fate. Our force by landHath nobly held; our sever'd navy tooHave knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?If from the field I shall return once moreTo kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;I and my sword will earn our chronicle:There's hope in't yet.That's my brave lord!I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,And fight maliciously: for when mine hoursWere nice and lucky, men did ransom livesOf me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,Let's have one other gaudy night: call to meAll my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;Let's mock the midnight bell.It is my birth-day:I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lordIs Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.We will yet do well.Call all his noble captains to my lord.Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll forceThe wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,I'll make death love me; for I will contendEven with his pestilent scythe.Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that moodThe dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,A diminution in our captain's brainRestores his heart: when valour preys on reason,It eats the sword it fights with. I will seekSome way to leave him.
