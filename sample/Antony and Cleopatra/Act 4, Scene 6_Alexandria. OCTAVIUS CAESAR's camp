Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight:Our will is Antony be took alive;Make it so known.Caesar, I shall.The time of universal peace is near:Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd worldShall bear the olive freely.AntonyIs come into the field.Go charge AgrippaPlant those that have revolted in the van,That Antony may seem to spend his furyUpon himself.Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry onAffairs of Antony; there did persuadeGreat Herod to incline himself to Caesar,And leave his master Antony: for this painsCaesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the restThat fell away have entertainment, butNo honourable trust. I have done ill;Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,That I will joy no more.Enobarbus, AntonyHath after thee sent all thy treasure, withHis bounty overplus: the messengerCame on my guard; and at thy tent is nowUnloading of his mules.I give it you.Mock not, Enobarbus.I tell you true: best you safed the bringerOut of the host; I must attend mine office,Or would have done't myself. Your emperorContinues still a Jove.I am alone the villain of the earth,And feel I am so most. O Antony,Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paidMy better service, when my turpitudeThou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:If swift thought break it not, a swifter meanShall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.I fight against thee! No: I will go seekSome ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fitsMy latter part of life.
