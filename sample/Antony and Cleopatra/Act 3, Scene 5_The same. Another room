How now, friend Eros!There's strange news come, sir.What, man?Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.This is old: what is the success?Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainstPompey, presently denied him rivality; would not lethim partake in the glory of the action: and notresting here, accuses him of letters he had formerlywrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: sothe poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;And throw between them all the food thou hast,They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurnsThe rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'And threats the throat of that his officerThat murder'd Pompey.Our great navy's rigg'd.For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;My lord desires you presently: my newsI might have told hereafter.'Twill be naught:But let it be. Bring me to Antony.Come, sir.
