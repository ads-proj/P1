If the great gods be just, they shall assistThe deeds of justest men.Know, worthy Pompey,That what they do delay, they not deny.Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decaysThe thing we sue for.We, ignorant of ourselves,Beg often our own harms, which the wise powersDeny us for our good; so find we profitBy losing of our prayers.I shall do well:The people love me, and the sea is mine;My powers are crescent, and my auguring hopeSays it will come to the full. Mark AntonyIn Egypt sits at dinner, and will makeNo wars without doors: Caesar gets money whereHe loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,Nor either cares for him.Caesar and LepidusAre in the field: a mighty strength they carry.Where have you this? 'tis false.From Silvius, sir.He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooksSharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honourEven till a Lethe'd dulness!How now, Varrius!This is most certain that I shall deliver:Mark Antony is every hour in RomeExpected: since he went from Egypt 'tisA space for further travel.I could have given less matterA better ear. Menas, I did not thinkThis amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helmFor such a petty war: his soldiershipIs twice the other twain: but let us rearThe higher our opinion, that our stirringCan from the lap of Egypt's widow pluckThe ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.I cannot hopeCaesar and Antony shall well greet together:His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,Not moved by Antony.I know not, Menas,How lesser enmities may give way to greater.Were't not that we stand up against them all,'Twere pregnant they should square betweenthemselves;For they have entertained cause enoughTo draw their swords: but how the fear of usMay cement their divisions and bind upThe petty difference, we yet not know.Be't as our gods will have't! It only standsOur lives upon to use our strongest hands.Come, Menas.
