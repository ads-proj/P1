Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,Cleopatra and himself in chairs of goldWere publicly enthroned: at the feet satCaesarion, whom they call my father's son,And all the unlawful issue that their lustSince then hath made between them. Unto herHe gave the stablishment of Egypt; made herOf lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,Absolute queen.This in the public eye?I' the common show-place, where they exercise.His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'dSyria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: sheIn the habiliments of the goddess IsisThat day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,As 'tis reported, so.Let Rome be thus Inform'd.Who, queasy with his insolenceAlready, will their good thoughts call from him.The people know it; and have now receivedHis accusations.Who does he accuse?Caesar: and that, having in SicilySextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated himHis part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent meSome shipping unrestored: lastly, he fretsThat Lepidus of the triumvirateShould be deposed; and, being, that we detainAll his revenue.Sir, this should be answer'd.'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;That he his high authority abused,And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, IDemand the like.He'll never yield to that.Nor must not then be yielded to in this.Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!That ever I should call thee castaway!You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come notLike Caesar's sister: the wife of AntonyShould have an army for an usher, andThe neighs of horse to tell of her approachLong ere she did appear; the trees by the wayShould have borne men; and expectation fainted,Longing for what it had not; nay, the dustShould have ascended to the roof of heaven,Raised by your populous troops: but you are comeA market-maid to Rome; and have preventedThe ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,Is often left unloved; we should have met youBy sea and land; supplying every stageWith an augmented greeting.Good my lord,To come thus was I not constrain'd, but didOn my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,Hearing that you prepared for war, acquaintedMy grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'dHis pardon for return.Which soon he granted,Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.Do not say so, my lord.I have eyes upon him,And his affairs come to me on the wind.Where is he now?My lord, in Athens.No, my most wronged sister; CleopatraHath nodded him to her. He hath given his empireUp to a whore; who now are levyingThe kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembledBocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, kingOf Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, kingOf Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,With a more larger list of sceptres.Ay me, most wretched,That have my heart parted betwixt two friendsThat do afflict each other!Welcome hither:Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;Be you not troubled with the time, which drivesO'er your content these strong necessities;But let determined things to destinyHold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;Nothing more dear to me. You are abusedBeyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,To do you justice, make them ministersOf us and those that love you. Best of comfort;And ever welcome to us.Welcome, lady.Welcome, dear madam.Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:Only the adulterous Antony, most largeIn his abominations, turns you off;And gives his potent regiment to a trull,That noises it against us.Is it so, sir?Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!
