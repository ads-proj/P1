The gods make this a happy day to Antony!Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'dTo make me fight at land!Hadst thou done so,The kings that have revolted, and the soldierThat has this morning left thee, would have stillFollow'd thy heels.Who's gone this morning?Who!One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's campSay 'I am none of thine.'What say'st thou?Sir,He is with Caesar.Sir, his chests and treasureHe has not with him.Is he gone?Most certain.Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;Say that I wish he never find more causeTo change a master. O, my fortunes haveCorrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!
