Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:Caesar himself has work, and our oppressionExceeds what we expected.O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!Had we done so at first, we had droven them homeWith clouts about their heads.Thou bleed'st apace.I had a wound here that was like a T,But now 'tis made an H.They do retire.We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yetRoom for six scotches more.They are beaten, sir, and our advantage servesFor a fair victory.Let us score their backs,And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:'Tis sport to maul a runner.I will reward theeOnce for thy spritely comfort, and ten-foldFor thy good valour. Come thee on.I'll halt after.
