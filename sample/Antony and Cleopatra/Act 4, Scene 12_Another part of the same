Yet they are not join'd: where yond pinedoes stand,I shall discover all: I'll bring thee wordStraight, how 'tis like to go.Swallows have builtIn Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurersSay they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,And dare not speak their knowledge. AntonyIs valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,Of what he has, and has not.All is lost;This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonderThey cast their caps up and carouse togetherLike friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!'tis thouHast sold me to this novice; and my heartMakes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;For when I am revenged upon my charm,I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:Fortune and Antony part here; even hereDo we shake hands. All come to this? The heartsThat spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gaveTheir wishes, do discandy, melt their sweetsOn blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.What, Eros, Eros!Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!Why is my lord enraged against his love?Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:Follow his chariot, like the greatest spotOf all thy sex; most monster-like, be shownFor poor'st diminutives, for doits; and letPatient Octavia plough thy visage upWith her prepared nails.'Tis well thou'rt gone,If it be well to live; but better 'twereThou fell'st into my fury, for one deathMight have prevented many. Eros, ho!The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fallUnder this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!
