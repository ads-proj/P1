We have beat him to his camp: run one before,And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the bloodThat has to-day escaped. I thank you all;For doughty-handed are you, and have foughtNot as you served the cause, but as 't had beenEach man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tearsWash the congealment from your wounds, and kissThe honour'd gashes whole.Give me thy handTo this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,Make her thanks bless thee.O thou day o' the world,Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,Through proof of harness to my heart, and thereRide on the pants triumphing!Lord of lords!O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling fromThe world's great snare uncaught?My nightingale,We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!though greyDo something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' weA brain that nourishes our nerves, and canGet goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-dayAs if a god, in hate of mankind, hadDestroy'd in such a shape.I'll give thee, friend,An armour all of gold; it was a king's.He has deserved it, were it carbuncledLike holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:Through Alexandria make a jolly march;Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:Had our great palace the capacityTo camp this host, we all would sup together,And drink carouses to the next day's fate,Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,With brazen din blast you the city's ear;Make mingle with rattling tabourines;That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,Applauding our approach.
