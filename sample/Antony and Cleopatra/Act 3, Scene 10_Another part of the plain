Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:To see't mine eyes are blasted.Gods and goddesses,All the whole synod of them!What's thy passion!The greater cantle of the world is lostWith very ignorance; we have kiss'd awayKingdoms and provinces.How appears the fight?On our side like the token'd pestilence,Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,The breese upon her, like a cow in June,Hoists sails and flies.That I beheld:Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could notEndure a further view.She once being loof'd,The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:I never saw an action of such shame;Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er beforeDid violate so itself.Alack, alack!Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,And sinks most lamentably. Had our generalBeen what he knew himself, it had gone well:O, he has given example for our flight,Most grossly, by his own!Ay, are you thereabouts?Why, then, good night indeed.Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.'Tis easy to't; and there I will attendWhat further comes.To Caesar will I renderMy legions and my horse: six kings alreadyShow me the way of yielding.I'll yet followThe wounded chance of Antony, though my reasonSits in the wind against me.
