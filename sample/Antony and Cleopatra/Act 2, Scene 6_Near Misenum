Your hostages I have, so have you mine;And we shall talk before we fight.Most meetThat first we come to words; and therefore have weOur written purposes before us sent;Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us knowIf 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,And carry back to Sicily much tall youthThat else must perish here.To you all three,The senators alone of this great world,Chief factors for the gods, I do not knowWherefore my father should revengers want,Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,There saw you labouring for him. What was'tThat moved pale Cassius to conspire; and whatMade the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,To drench the Capitol; but that they wouldHave one man but a man? And that is itHath made me rig my navy; at whose burthenThe anger'd ocean foams; with which I meantTo scourge the ingratitude that despiteful RomeCast on my noble father.Take your time.Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'stHow much we do o'er-count thee.At land, indeed,Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,Remain in't as thou mayst.Be pleased to tell us--For this is from the present--how you takeThe offers we have sent you.There's the point.Which do not be entreated to, but weighWhat it is worth embraced.And what may follow,To try a larger fortune.You have made me offerOf Sicily, Sardinia; and I mustRid all the sea of pirates; then, to sendMeasures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed uponTo part with unhack'd edges, and bear backOur targes undinted.That's our offer.Know, then,I came before you here a man preparedTo take this offer: but Mark AntonyPut me to some impatience: though I loseThe praise of it by telling, you must know,When Caesar and your brother were at blows,Your mother came to Sicily and did findHer welcome friendly.I have heard it, Pompey;And am well studied for a liberal thanksWhich I do owe you.Let me have your hand:I did not think, sir, to have met you here.The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;For I have gain'd by 't.Since I saw you last,There is a change upon you.Well, I know notWhat counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;But in my bosom shall she never come,To make my heart her vassal.Well met here.I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:I crave our composition may be written,And seal'd between us.That's the next to do.We'll feast each other ere we part; and let'sDraw lots who shall begin.That will I, Pompey.No, Antony, take the lot: but, firstOr last, your fine Egyptian cookeryShall have the fame. I have heard that Julius CaesarGrew fat with feasting there.You have heard much.I have fair meanings, sir.And fair words to them.Then so much have I heard:And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--No more of that: he did so.What, I pray you?A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?Well;And well am like to do; for, I perceive,Four feasts are toward.Let me shake thy hand;I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,When I have envied thy behavior.Sir,I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,When you have well deserved ten times as muchAs I have said you did.Enjoy thy plainness,It nothing ill becomes thee.Aboard my galley I invite you all:Will you lead, lords?Show us the way, sir.Come.[Aside]  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er havemade this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.At sea, I think.We have, sir.You have done well by water.And you by land.I will praise any man that will praise me; though itcannot be denied what I have done by land.Nor what I have done by water.Yes, something you can deny for your ownsafety: you have been a great thief by sea.And you by land.There I deny my land service. But give me yourhand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here theymight take two thieves kissing.All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.But there is never a fair woman has a true face.No slander; they steal hearts.We came hither to fight with you.For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antonyhere: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?Caesar's sister is called Octavia.True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.Pray ye, sir?'Tis true.Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.If I were bound to divine of this unity, I wouldnot prophesy so.I think the policy of that purpose made more in themarriage than the love of the parties.I think so too. But you shall find, the band thatseems to tie their friendship together will be thevery strangler of their amity: Octavia is of aholy, cold, and still conversation.Who would not have his wife so?Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall thesighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, asI said before, that which is the strength of theiramity shall prove the immediate author of theirvariance. Antony will use his affection where it is:he married but his occasion here.And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?I have a health for you.I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.Come, let's away.
