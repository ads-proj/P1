I will be even with thee, doubt it not.But why, why, why?Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,And say'st it is not fit.Well, is it, is it?If not denounced against us, why should not weBe there in person?[Aside]  Well, I could reply:If we should serve with horse and mares together,The horse were merely lost; the mares would bearA soldier and his horse.What is't you say?Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;Take from his heart, take from his brain,from's time,What should not then be spared. He is alreadyTraduced for levity; and 'tis said in RomeThat Photinus an eunuch and your maidsManage this war.Sink Rome, and their tongues rotThat speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,And, as the president of my kingdom, willAppear there for a man. Speak not against it:I will not stay behind.Nay, I have done.Here comes the emperor.Is it not strange, Canidius,That from Tarentum and BrundusiumHe could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?Celerity is never more admiredThan by the negligent.A good rebuke,Which might have well becomed the best of men,To taunt at slackness. Canidius, weWill fight with him by sea.By sea! what else?Why will my lord do so?For that he dares us to't.So hath my lord dared him to single fight.Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;And so should you.Your ships are not well mann'd;Your mariners are muleters, reapers, peopleIngross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleetAre those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgraceShall fall you for refusing him at sea,Being prepared for land.By sea, by sea.Most worthy sir, you therein throw awayThe absolute soldiership you have by land;Distract your army, which doth most consistOf war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecutedYour own renowned knowledge; quite foregoThe way which promises assurance; andGive up yourself merely to chance and hazard,From firm security.I'll fight at sea.I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.Our overplus of shipping will we burn;And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of ActiumBeat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,We then can do't at land.Thy business?The news is true, my lord; he is descried;Caesar has taken Toryne.Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;Strange that power should be. Canidius,Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:Away, my Thetis!How now, worthy soldier?O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubtThis sword and these my wounds? Let the EgyptiansAnd the Phoenicians go a-ducking; weHave used to conquer, standing on the earth,And fighting foot to foot.Well, well: away!By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.Soldier, thou art: but his whole action growsNot in the power on't: so our leader's led,And we are women's men.You keep by landThe legions and the horse whole, do you not?Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar'sCarries beyond belief.While he was yet in Rome,His power went out in such distractions asBeguiled all spies.Who's his lieutenant, hear you?They say, one Taurus.Well I know the man.The emperor calls Canidius.With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,Each minute, some.
