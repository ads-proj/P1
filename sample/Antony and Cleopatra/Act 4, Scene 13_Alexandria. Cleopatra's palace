Help me, my women! O, he is more madThan Telamon for his shield; the boar of ThessalyWas never so emboss'd.To the monument!There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.The soul and body rive not more in partingThan greatness going off.To the monument!Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,And bring me how he takes my death.To the monument!
