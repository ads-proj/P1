O Charmian, I will never go from hence.Be comforted, dear madam.No, I will not:All strange and terrible events are welcome,But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,Proportion'd to our cause, must be as greatAs that which makes it.How now! is he dead?His death's upon him, but not dead.Look out o' the other side your monument;His guard have brought him thither.O sun,Burn the great sphere thou movest in!darkling standThe varying shore o' the world. O Antony,Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.Peace!Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.So it should be, that none but AntonyShould conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!I am dying, Egypt, dying; onlyI here importune death awhile, untilOf many thousand kisses the poor lastI lay up thy lips.I dare not, dear,--Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,Lest I be taken: not the imperious showOf the full-fortuned Caesar ever shallBe brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,serpents, haveEdge, sting, or operation, I am safe:Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyesAnd still conclusion, shall acquire no honourDemuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:Assist, good friends.O, quick, or I am gone.Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!Our strength is all gone into heaviness,That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,Thus would I wear them out.A heavy sight!I am dying, Egypt, dying:Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,Provoked by my offence.One word, sweet queen:Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!They do not go together.Gentle, hear me:None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.My resolution and my hands I'll trust;None about Caesar.The miserable change now at my endLament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughtsIn feeding them with those my former fortunesWherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,The noblest; and do now not basely die,Not cowardly put off my helmet toMy countryman,--a Roman by a RomanValiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;I can no more.Noblest of men, woo't die?Hast thou no care of me? shall I abideIn this dull world, which in thy absence isNo better than a sty? O, see, my women,The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!O, wither'd is the garland of the war,The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girlsAre level now with men; the odds is gone,And there is nothing left remarkableBeneath the visiting moon.O, quietness, lady!She is dead too, our sovereign.Lady!Madam!O madam, madam, madam!Royal Egypt, Empress!Peace, peace, Iras!No more, but e'en a woman, and commandedBy such poor passion as the maid that milksAnd does the meanest chares. It were for meTo throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;To tell them that this world did equal theirsTill they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;Patience is scottish, and impatience doesBecome a dog that's mad: then is it sinTo rush into the secret house of death,Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,what's noble,Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,And make death proud to take us. Come, away:This case of that huge spirit now is cold:Ah, women, women! come; we have no friendBut resolution, and the briefest end.
