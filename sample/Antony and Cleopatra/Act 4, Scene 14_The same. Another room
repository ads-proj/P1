Eros, thou yet behold'st me?Ay, noble lord.Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,A forked mountain, or blue promontoryWith trees upon't, that nod unto the world,And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seenthese signs;They are black vesper's pageants.Ay, my lord,That which is now a horse, even with a thoughtThe rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,As water is in water.It does, my lord.My good knave Eros, now thy captain isEven such a body: here I am Antony:Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto'tA million more, now lost,--she, Eros, hasPack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my gloryUnto an enemy's triumph.Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left usOurselves to end ourselves.O! thy vile lady!She has robb'd me of my sword.No, Antony;My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingledWith thine entirely.Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.Death of one person can be paid but once,And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst doIs done unto thy hand: the last she spakeWas 'Antony! most noble Antony!'Then in the midst a tearing groan did breakThe name of Antony; it was dividedBetween her heart and lips: she render'd life,Thy name so buried in her.Dead, then?Dead.Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,And we must sleep.That thou depart'st hence safe,Does pay thy labour richly; go.Off, pluck off:The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keepThe battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, andWeep for my pardon. So it must be, for nowAll length is torture: since the torch is out,Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labourMars what it does; yea, very force entanglesItself with strength: seal then, and all is done.Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!What would my lord?Since Cleopatra died,I have lived in such dishonour, that the godsDetest my baseness. I, that with my swordQuarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's backWith ships made cities, condemn myself to lackThe courage of a woman; less noble mindThan she which by her death our Caesar tells'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,That, when the exigent should come, which nowIs come indeed, when I should see behind meThe inevitable prosecution ofDisgrace and horror, that, on my command,Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.Put colour in thy cheek.The gods withhold me!Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?Eros,Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and seeThy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending downHis corrigible neck, his face subduedTo penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seatOf fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, brandedHis baseness that ensued?I would not see't.Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast wornMost useful for thy country.O, sir, pardon me!When I did make thee free, sworest thou not thenTo do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;Or thy precedent services are allBut accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.Lo thee!My sword is drawn.Then let it do at onceThe thing why thou hast drawn it.My dear master,My captain, and my emperor, let me say,Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.'Tis said, man; and farewell.Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?Now, Eros.Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrowOf Antony's death.Thrice-nobler than myself!Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, whatI should, and thou couldst not. My queen and ErosHave by their brave instruction got upon meA nobleness in record: but I will beA bridegroom in my death, and run into'tAs to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thusI learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!What's the noise?I have done my work in, friends: O, make an endOf what I have begun.The star is fall'n.And time is at his period.Alas, and woe!Let him that loves me strike me dead.Not I.Nor I.Nor any one.Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,Shall enter me with him.Where's Antony?There, Diomed there.Lives he?Wilt thou not answer, man?Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give meSufficing strokes for death.Most absolute lord,My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.When did she send thee?Now, my lord.Where is she?Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fearOf what hath come to pass: for when she saw--Which never shall be found--you did suspectShe had disposed with Caesar, and that your rageWould not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;But, fearing since how it might work, hath sentMe to proclaim the truth; and I am come,I dread, too late.Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!Come, your lord calls!Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;'Tis the last service that I shall command you.Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wearAll your true followers out.Most heavy day!Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fateTo grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcomeWhich comes to punish us, and we punish itSeeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,And have my thanks for all.
