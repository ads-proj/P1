Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hastenYour generals after.Sir, Mark AntonyWill e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,Which will become you both, farewell.We shall,As I conceive the journey, be at the MountBefore you, Lepidus.Your way is shorter;My purposes do draw me much about:You'll win two days upon me.Sir, good success!Farewell.
