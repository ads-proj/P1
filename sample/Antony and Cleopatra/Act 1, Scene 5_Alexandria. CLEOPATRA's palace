Charmian!Madam?Ha, ha!Give me to drink mandragora.Why, madam?That I might sleep out this great gap of timeMy Antony is away.You think of him too much.O, 'tis treason!Madam, I trust, not so.Thou, eunuch Mardian!What's your highness' pleasure?Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasureIn aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughtsMay not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?Yes, gracious madam.Indeed!Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothingBut what indeed is honest to be done:Yet have I fierce affections, and thinkWhat Venus did with Mars.O Charmian,Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?The demi-Atlas of this earth, the armAnd burgonet of men. He's speaking now,Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'For so he calls me: now I feed myselfWith most delicious poison. Think on me,That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,When thou wast here above the ground, I wasA morsel for a monarch: and great PompeyWould stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;There would he anchor his aspect and dieWith looking on his life.Sovereign of Egypt, hail!How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hathWith his tinct gilded thee.How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?Last thing he did, dear queen,He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.Mine ear must pluck it thence.'Good friend,' quoth he,'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sendsThis treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,To mend the petty present, I will pieceHer opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spokeWas beastly dumb'd by him.What, was he sad or merry?Like to the time o' the year between the extremesOf hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.O well-divided disposition! Note him,Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:He was not sad, for he would shine on thoseThat make their looks by his; he was not merry,Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance layIn Egypt with his joy; but between both:O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,The violence of either thee becomes,So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:Why do you send so thick?Who's born that dayWhen I forget to send to Antony,Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,Ever love Caesar so?O that brave Caesar!Be choked with such another emphasis!Say, the brave Antony.The valiant Caesar!By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,If thou with Caesar paragon againMy man of men.By your most gracious pardon,I sing but after you.My salad days,When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,To say as I said then! But, come, away;Get me ink and paper:He shall have every day a several greeting,Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
