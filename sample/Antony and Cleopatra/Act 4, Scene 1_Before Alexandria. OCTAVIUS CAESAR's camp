He calls me boy; and chides, as he had powerTo beat me out of Egypt; my messengerHe hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian knowI have many other ways to die; meantimeLaugh at his challenge.Caesar must think,When one so great begins to rage, he's huntedEven to falling. Give him no breath, but nowMake boot of his distraction: never angerMade good guard for itself.Let our best headsKnow, that to-morrow the last of many battlesWe mean to fight: within our files there are,Of those that served Mark Antony but late,Enough to fetch him in. See it done:And feast the army; we have store to do't,And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!
