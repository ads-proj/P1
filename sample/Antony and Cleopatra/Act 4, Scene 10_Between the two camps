Their preparation is to-day by sea;We please them not by land.For both, my lord.I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our footUpon the hills adjoining to the cityShall stay with us: order for sea is given;They have put forth the havenWhere their appointment we may best discover,And look on their endeavour.
