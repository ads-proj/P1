Post speedily to my lord your husband; show himthis letter: the army of France is landed. Seekout the villain Gloucester.Hang him instantly.Pluck out his eyes.Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you oursister company: the revenges we are bound to takeupon your traitorous father are not fit for yourbeholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, toa most festinate preparation: we are bound to thelike. Our posts shall be swift and intelligentbetwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, mylord of Gloucester.How now! where's the king?My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:Some five or six and thirty of his knights,Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;Who, with some other of the lords dependants,Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boastTo have well-armed friends.Get horses for your mistress.Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.Edmund, farewell.Go seek the traitor Gloucester,Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.Though well we may not pass upon his lifeWithout the form of justice, yet our powerShall do a courtesy to our wrath, which menMay blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.Bind fast his corky arms.What mean your graces? Good my friends, considerYou are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.Bind him, I say.Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly doneTo pluck me by the beard.So white, and such a traitor!Naughty lady,These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:With robbers' hands my hospitable favoursYou should not ruffle thus. What will you do?Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.And what confederacy have you with the traitorsLate footed in the kingdom?To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.I have a letter guessingly set down,Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,And not from one opposed.Cunning.And false.Where hast thou sent the king?To Dover.Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.Wherefore to Dover, sir?Because I would not see thy cruel nailsPluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sisterIn his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.The sea, with such a storm as his bare headIn hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,And quench'd the stelled fires:Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'All cruels else subscribed: but I shall seeThe winged vengeance overtake such children.See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.He that will think to live till he be old,Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!One side will mock another; the other too.If you see vengeance,--Hold your hand, my lord:I have served you ever since I was a child;But better service have I never done youThan now to bid you hold.How now, you dog!If you did wear a beard upon your chin,I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?My villain!Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye leftTo see some mischief on him. O!Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!Where is thy lustre now?All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,To quit this horrid act.Out, treacherous villain!Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was heThat made the overture of thy treasons to us;Who is too good to pity thee.O my follies! then Edgar was abused.Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smellHis way to Dover.How is't, my lord? how look you?I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slaveUpon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.I'll never care what wickedness I do,If this man come to good.If she live long,And in the end meet the old course of death,Women will all turn monsters.Let's follow the old earl, and get the BedlamTo lead him where he would: his roguish madnessAllows itself to any thing.Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggsTo apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!
