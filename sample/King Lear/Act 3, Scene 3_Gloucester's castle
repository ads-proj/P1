Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnaturaldealing. When I desire their leave that I mightpity him, they took from me the use of mine ownhouse; charged me, on pain of their perpetualdispleasure, neither to speak of him, entreat forhim, nor any way sustain him.Most savage and unnatural!Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixtthe dukes; and a worse matter than that: I havereceived a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to bespoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:these injuries the king now bears will be revengedhome; there's part of a power already footed: wemust incline to the king. I will seek him, andprivily relieve him: go you and maintain talk withthe duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,the king my old master must be relieved. There issome strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the dukeInstantly know; and of that letter too:This seems a fair deserving, and must draw meThat which my father loses; no less than all:The younger rises when the old doth fall.
