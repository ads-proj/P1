Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing youknow than comes from her demand out of the letter.If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.I will not sleep, my lord, till I have deliveredyour letter.If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not indanger of kibes?Ay, boy.Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er goslip-shod.Ha, ha, ha!Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;for though she's as like this as a crab's like anapple, yet I can tell what I can tell.Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?She will taste as like this as a crab does to acrab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'the middle on's face?No.Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; thatwhat a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.I did her wrong--Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?No.Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.Why?Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to hisdaughters, and leave his horns without a case.I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be myhorses ready?Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why theseven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.Because they are not eight?Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beatenfor being old before thy time.How's that?Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadstbeen wise.O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heavenKeep me in temper: I would not be mad!How now! are the horses ready?Ready, my lord.Come, boy.She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.
